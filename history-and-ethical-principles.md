Research with human subjects has a long and troubled history throughout the world (Dacau, Unit 731, Tuskegee). Research ethics codes were created to address unethical research and abuses. Ethical research guidelines were enumerated in the nuremburg codes. The national commision for the protection of human subjects of biomedical and behavioral research established a code of research ethics for the U.S. The commission issued the Belmont report, outlining three key ethical principles for conducting reasearch on human subjects. [ Respect for persons, Beneficence, Justice ]. The findings of the Belmont report caused the USD of Health and Human Services to pass new federal regulations. Some revisions have come out since then. Milgram's Obedience to Authority study, the prison experiment, and humphreys tearoom trade study made it clear that social and behavioral research may carry risks of harm. 

**Learning Objectives**

    - Understand the historic context of the Belmont Report.
    - Identify the three ethical principles described in the Belmont Report.
    - Describe the relationship between the Belmont principles and federal regulations.
    - Discuss examples of how the ethical principles can be applied to research in the social and behavioral sciences, education, and humanities.

## Respect for persons. 
Respect for persons requires two ethical convictions. Individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection. 

### Autonomy
Individuals must be given the choice to participate in research, and they must be provided sufficient information and possess the mental competence to make that choice. The mentally handicapped may lack the ability to comprehend study procedures and adverse affects. Children have limited autonomy. 

### Voluntariness
Research subjects must be free to choose to participate, and must be free to end their participation for any reason, without consequences. Researchers should be aware of circumstances that may make a subject feel pressured into participation. Personal relations between researchers and research participants may blur the line between voluntariness and undue influence. Undue influence can occor when  employers conduct research with their employees, or professors conduct research with their students.

### Informed consent
Informed consent protects the autonomy of the research subject. Informed consent requires [ Disclosure of information required to make an informed decision, Ensuring the subject comprehends this information, encouraging the vouluntariness of the decision to participate ]

Key information should be provided at the beginning of the consent document. Researchers should create consent processes that are at an appropriate language level for the subject population. Eighth grade reading level or below. 

When conducting research in other language, take care to ensure accuracy, explain idiomatic expressions, etc. 

### The principles in practice
Humphreys observed men meeting other men for casual sex in public restrooms, recording their license plate numbers. This (obviously) violated the subjects' autonomy. This wouldn't fly today.

Harvard's Tastes, Ties, and Time study used facebook information to build profiles of undergraduate students. This data was published, and the profiles were detailed enough to do reverse lookups. This is called "Failure of researchers to protect subjects from deductive disclosure".

## Beneficence
Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm, but also by making efforts to secure their well-being. There are two rules. [ Do no harm, Maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms ]

### Minimizing harm and maximizing benefit
Most research in social and behavioral sciences do not provide direct benefit to subjects, and the risk of harm is quite low. If risks are present, they should be in reasonable relation to anticipated benefits. The most common risks are psychological distress and inadvertent disclosure of private identifiable information. Studies of sexuality, mental health, interpersonal violence, and illegal activities carry the risks of feelings of distress, embarrassment, and reputational harm. Researchers may use Pseudonyms, but this is not a magic bullet for reverse lookups. Deception is permissible if researchers provide justificatioin for the deception and prepare debriefing procedures for the subjects at the end of the study. The debrief must include rationale. **Data security and the very notion of privacy have changed dramatically with the explosion of social media, cloud storage, data mining of web-based information, and re-identification techniques.** 87 percent of Americans can be uniquely identified by only three bits of demographic information: ffive-digit zip code, gender, and date of birth.

### The principles in practice
Nancy Scheper-Hughes published a book about mental illness in rural Ireland. The data was so poorly sanitized that people were able to identify their neighbors. This carried risks of social and reputational harm. Boston college was subpoena'd by the british government to disclose 85 interviews with former IRA members. This is an example of legal harm. 

## Justice
Who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear its burdens? This is a question of justice, in the sense of "fairness in distribution" and "what is deserved". Denying benefits to which a person is entitled, or unduly imposed burdeons are unjust. 

### Distributing Benefits and Burdens of Research 

Justice requires that the benefits and burdens of research are equitably distributed. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the burdens of serving as research subjects fell upon the poor, while the benefits were reaped by the aristocrats and capitalists. Tuskegee Study and Nazi experiments are research injustices. Researchers are discouraged from using prisoners as research subjects just because they are convenient. Same with professors and students, employees and employers, or users of social media. In non medical research, justice is more nuanced. Subjects should be filtered by qualities relevant to the research. Researchers need to consider how to disclose findings to subjects. Joan E Sieber maintains that research or its interpretation may contain an inherent bias that singles out a particular group, or reinforces unjust treatment. IQ and steralization, and so on. "An idea that creates prejudices agains some sector of society is unfair. An experimental treatment is also unfair if resources are not equatibly provided. 

### The principles in practice
In educational research, the control group must receive standard instruction.

### Balancing the three principles
All three principles must have equal moral force. One principle does not always outweigh another. Rather, each case is to be considered separately, while trying to uphold all three principles. If a review board feels that deception is justified, beneficence holds greater weight than respect for persons. 

## The Belmont Report and the Common Rule
The common rule list criteria for IRB approval of a research plan.

### Respect for persons
    - Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by 46.116.
    - Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with, and to the extent required by 46.117.
    - When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
    - When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.

### Beneficence
    - Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.
    - Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.
    - When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.
    - When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.

### Justice
    - Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted and should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.

## Summary
The horrors of the pre modern era can be averted with application of ethical principles.
