# Privacy and confidentiality
The Common Rule (45 CFR 46, Subpart A) states that when reviewing research proposals, IRBs must determine that there are adequate provisions for protecting the privacy of subjects and maintaining the confidentiality of data.

The common rule is just one document that directs researchers to consider privacy and confidentiality when conducting research. The guidelines of the American Anthropological Association, the Oral History Association, the Americal Psychological Association, and the American Sociological Association, identify protecting privacy and ensuring confidentiality as key components of respecting the safety and dignity of research subjects.

Learning objectives:
 - Distinguish between privacy and confidentiality
 - Identify privacy risks associated with study designs.
 - Identify a range of procedures for ensuring confidentiality
 - Identify relevant lawas regarding the collection of private information
 - Identify laws that limit the ability to ensure confidentiality

## Definitions
The IRB Guidebook defines privacy and confidentiality. 

- Privacy : Having control over the extent, timing, and circumstances of sharing oneself (physically, behaviorally, or intellectually) with others
- Confidentiality : Treatment of information that an individual has disclosed in a relationship of trust and with the expectation that it will not be divulged to others, in ways that are inconsistent with the understanding of the original disclosure without permission. 

Although privacy and confidentiality are closely related, they are not identical. Privacy is related to methods of gathering information from research subjects; confidentiality refers to the obligations of researchers and institutions to appropriately protect the information disclosed to them.

Confidentiality procedures, as described during the informed consent process, allow subjects to decide what measure of control over their personal information they are willing to relinquish to researchers. 

It is not always the case that identifiable information provided by research subjects must be protected from disclosure. Some subjects want ot be identified and quoted. Some agree to have their photographs, audio, or video recordings published or otherwise made available to the public. 

## Identifying Private Information
Federal regulations define private informatio to mean "information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an indivdual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (e.g, a medical record)"

Private information rests on subjects' reasonable assumption of privacy. 

Applying the reasonable assumption standard is not  a simple task. It would be unreasonable to assume that behavior on a street corner or a public park is private, but reasonable to assume that behavior in our homes is private. However, given that technology makes it possible to film and record conversations from considerable distances, a third kind of space may be emerging: private spaces in the midst of very public ones. Parents taking their children to a city park might justifiably consider it a violation of privacy if the interactions of their children were audiotaped using long-range recording devices. 

Reasonable assumptions regarding privacy will vary from culture to culture, and setting to setting. For example, in some cultures, health information is considered very private, but in others, information about people's health is part of the community dialogue, and widely shared.

Reasonable assumptions about privacy may vary among generations. The legal maxim that privacy is the "right to be let alone" comes from a world where privacy was seen as threatened by, among other things, the technologies that allowed still photographs to appear in mass-circulated newspapers. Now, through social media, people use images to document their behavior and that of their friends and family, sometimes without restricting public access to the images. It may be difficult to discern if and when people feel their use of the internet is public or private. 

## Controlling Access to Private Information
Individuals' ability to control access to their bodies and their personal information is determined by a variety of factors, including socioeconomic status, age, and circumstance.

For example, information about birth records is public information while information about personal stock portfolios is not. Children have different right to privacy than adults. Institutionalized persons may have significant limitations on their ability to control personal information. 

## Privacy and Research Methods
While not an exhaustive list, the following material highlights some concerns about privacy in the context of research. 

### Observational studies
In some observational studies, researchers participate in the activities being observed and the subjects know that the researchers have dual roles both as participants and as researchers.

However, if subjects are observed and private identifiable information is gathered about them without their knowledge and consent, there is a c lear violation of their right to privacy. 

Determining whether covert observation can be condidered ethically sound depends on answers to the questions such as whether the invasion of privacy is justified by the potential benefit of the study and what, if anything, the subjects will be told after the data are collected. For example, a researcher interested in the effects of subliminal priming on the choice between healthy and unhealthy snacks made available to subjects during a "break" between study tasks, may videotape the subjects during the break without their knowledge. Can the researcher articulate a potential benefit? Should the subjects be given the opportunity to ask that the film of their behavior be destroyed? 

### Focus groups
"It is not possible for a researcher to promise confidentiality in a focus group setting."

Focus groups are unique settings in which both privacy and confidentiality may be issues. In effect, focus group participants relinquish control of the extent, timing, and circumstances of sharing themselves because other group members may repeat what they say outside the group. This may occor even if researchers emphasize that comments made during the focus group session should not be repeated. Researchers may protect recordings and transcripts themselves, but they have no authority to enlist participants in agreements to appropriately protect the information shared. Researchers can encourage participants to be honest and open as they can, but when the topic warrants, also should encourage them to remain mindful of the limits on the researcher's ability to protect their privacy.

### Snowball Sampling
Snowball sampling is a recruitment technique in which research participants are asked to assist in identifying other potential subjects. If the topic of the research is not sensitive or personal, it may be appropriate for subjects to provide researchers with names of people who might be interested in participation. If the topic is sensitive or personal, such as the fact that someone was adopted, considerable care should be taken to so that potential subjects' privacy is not violated. In this case, subjects assisting with recruiting could provide information about the research to potential subjects, rather than giving the researcher names of potential subjects. 

## Privacy and Study Questions
Invasions of privacy can occor if subjects are asked questions that they find intrusive. If a survey instrument or an interview script contains questions that individuals are likely to find intrusive, they must be informed about the nature of the questions in advance. 

Examples of sensitive nature topics include sexual behavior, childhood abuse, use of psychotropic medications, or other personal topics.

Studies about possible topics that are of a sensitive nature should include a disclosure in the consent form about the sensitive nature of the questions. The survey instrument or interview process must be designed so that subjects may choose not to answer any question that makes them uncomfortable, or that they want to skip for any reason. 

Cultural standards should be taken into account when designing research. Topics that are considered appropriate in one setting may be offensive and off-limits in another. 

## Protecting Communications with subjects
If a study is obviously about stigmatizing conditions, illegal activities, or life experiances that subjects may not want others to know about, communications with the subjects should not reveal their participation in the study to others. To do so would violate the subjects' right to privacy. Study titles should be carefully considered; it is often best if the title does not reveal sensitive information about subjects. 

A method of communication that is of particular concern is email. Employee email is not secure and some personal accounts may be accessed by anyone in the family. Telephone calls to subjects at home may be of concern. It may be appropriate to script calls carefully so that no information is revealed about the caller or the reason for the call to anyone other than the subject. In some cases, it may be appropriate to remind subjects to prevent possible violations of their privacy in their homes by, for example, closing browsers after completing an online survey on a sensitive topic. 

## Confidentiality
Researchers provide confidentiality to their subjects by appropriately protecting information the subjects disclose. The potential risk of harm to subjects if identifiable data were inadvertently disclosed is the key factor for determining what kinds of protections are needed.

The ideal way to protect research data is to not collect information that could identify subjects. Collection of direct identifiers, such as names or email addresses, or indirect identifiers, such as information that could be used to deduce subjects' identities, should be avoided.

The only way to render data entirely anonymous is to remove all identifying information from the data and completely disconnect any links between the subjects and data about the subjects.

If researchers plan to retain individually identifiable data that could place participants at risk of harm if inadvernently disclosed, researchers need to design procedures to protect the data during collection, storage, analysis, and reporting. These procedures could include creating keys linking subjects' names to unique numbers associated with the data, storing encrypted data on secure servers, removing identifiers when data collection is completed, reporting data in aggregate, and creating misleading identifiers in articles or presentations. 

Consent forms should clearly explan who will have access to identifiable data, both in the present and in the future, and describe any future uses of the data. The consent forms must also contain a statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained, Also, federal regulations require that researchers must include one of the following statements on the consent form
 - A statement that identifiers will be removed from the identifiable private information and that after the data are de-identified they could be used for future research studies or distributed to another researcher; or
 - A statement that the subjects information collected as part of the research, even if identifiers are removed, will not be used or distributed for future research studies. 

For example, if researchers want to show video clips of research subjects during conference presentations or use them in a classroom, the subjects must be asked for permission to use their images in those ways. 

## Privacy and Reporting Laws
Under the common rule, the IRB is tasked with assessing whether the study plan has adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. However, there are other regulations and laws that also address privacy and confidentiality in research.

### Federal Privacy Laws
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the disclosure of educational records, while HIPPA protects against the dissemination of private health information. 

Generally, under FERPA, the disclosure of these records to researchers involves securing written authorizations from the potential subjects (students or their parents), although in certain clearly defined circumstance, the requirement to secure authorizations may be waived.

Researchers in the social and behavioral sciences, as well as the humanities, usually do not generate private health information covered by HIPAA. Rather, they ask for it to be disclosed to them, usually by asking subjects to sign authorizations permitting the disclosure. Most institutions covered by HIPAA have models of authorization forms that they expect researchers to use. 

### State Reporting Requirements
State reporting laws may cover matters such as specific communicable diseases, suspected child abuse/neglect, elder abuse, or intent to harm oneself or others. 

State reporting laws may limit the promises of confidentiality that researchers can offer subjects. Most state lwas identify individuals who must report suspected child abuse/neglect. This requirement should be described when child abuse/neglect might be revealed in a research study. Such studies could involve at-risk youth, school-based interventions, or parenting practices, among others.

On the other hand, there are many studies in which it is extremely unlikely that the topic would arise or that the researcher would be in a position to observe neglect or abuse. For example, a study of decision-making strategies using computer based activities would not generate information about child abuse, and there would be no need to discuss reporting requirements during the consent process. 

Researchers should consult with the reviewing IRB about the laws in the state or local area where the research will occor.

### International Privacy Laws
Researchers conducting research abroad should identify privacy lawas at the research site that may be relevant for the conduct of research with human subjects. 

Regulations such as GDPR may affect research that is conducted in Europe and even in the U.S.

### Exempt Research
Under the common rule, the IRB is tasked with assessing whether the study plan has adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data

## Certificates of Confidentiality
Certificates of Confidentiality are issued by the NIH to protect identifiable research information from compelled disclosure. 

Certificates of Confidentiality protec all copies of information, documents, biospecimens, that are collected or used by the investigator during the research. 

Certificates of Confidentiality protect the privacy of research participants by prohibiting disclosure of identifiable, sensitive research information. 

### Protections and Limitations
The Certificate of Confidentiality protections also cover copies of information, documents, and biospecimens shared for other research activities. These protections are permanent and do not expire. Researchers must inform participants about the protections and limitations to the protections with a Certificate of Confidentiality.

Certificates of Confidentiality do not override the requirement to report the suspicion of child abuse or neglect, or other applicable federal, state, or local law mandating reporting, such as reporting of a communicable diseas or elder abuse.

Other federal agencies, such as the DOJ provide agency specific protections that apply to research conducted or funded by the agency.

### NIH Policy
Under the Certificate of Confidentiality policy, NIH-funded investigators do not need to apply for a CoC, nor will they receive a physical certificate. The NIH issues CoC's automatically for "NIH funded grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and intramural research projects research funded wholly or in part by the NIH that collects of uses identifiable, sensitive information". Investigators are responsible for determining whether the NIH-funded research they conduct is automatically issued a certificate. Investigators must comply with the CoC's policy requirements, which include limited circumstances when the investigator may release a participant's identifiable information and inform anyone that receives a copy of the protected information about the certificate protections and disclosure restrictions. 

Non-NIH-funded investigators may apply for a CoC from the NIH or other HHS agency that issues Certificates for research studies. The NIH will consider requests for CoC's for specific research projects that are not funded by the NIH. These considerations include if the research project is collecting or using identifiable, sensitive information, if the research is on a topic that is within the NIH mission, or HHS health-related research mission, and if the research information associated with the project will be collected, used, or stored in the US. 

CoC protections are the same, regardless of source of research funding. 

## Summary
Although privacy and confidentialiy deal with different aspects of a study design, how these two issues are handled translate into issues of trust and security for a research participant.
