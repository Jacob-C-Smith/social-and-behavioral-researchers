# Populations in Research Requiring Additional Considerations and/or Protections
The national Bioethics Advisory Committee defines vulnerable subjects as persons who "have difficulty providing voluntary, informed consent arising from limitations in decision-making capacity... or situational circumstances... or because they are especially at risk for exploitation"

Many of the regulations and discussions in bioethics that surround protecting human subjects in research are reactions to cases now classified as unethical research practices. Many of these cases involved mistreatment of individuals or groups of individuals now referred to as vulnerable populations, or populations requiring additional considerations and/or protections. Some case examples include

- Jewish chronic disease hospital study
- US Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee
- Nazi Medical Experiments
- Tearoom Trade Study
- Willowbrook Hepatitis Study

In these cases, the research subjects were, for one reason or another, incapable of protecting their own interests. A lack of an ongoing informed consent process contributed to their vulnerability and allowed these events to occor. 

The events represent a checkered history and might lead one to ask why vulnerable populations are included in research at all. 

However, including vulnerable populations is important because in many cases, it is the source of their vulnerability which researchers are attempting to better understand, or  to devise ways to mitigate, reduce, accomodate, focus efforts on, or prevent.

The question of whether to include a vulnerable population in research leads to a more nuanced question. Once it has been answered affirmatively that it is permissible to conduct research with the identified group, the next step is to ask whether the research could include a less vulnerable population instead, and still answer the research question. One example is research on children. 

As noted by the National Commission (1977), "the argument in favor of conducting research involving children rests on... the consequences of not conducting research involving children in those instances. Such consequences might include the perpetuation of harmful practices, the introduction of untested practices, and the failure to develop new treatments for diseases that affect children"

Once the question of whether to include a potentially vulnerable population or those requiring additional protections and/or considerations is resolved, the challenge becomes understanding the details of these groups and their 
potential vulnerabilities. 

LO's

- Describe the different sources of vulnerability
- Distinguish between vulnerable populations in research who are specifically protected in the federal regulation and those who are not
- Identify additional protections for vulnerable populations who a re not specifically protected in the federal regulations
- Explain the effect on autonomy, beneficence, and justice that may arise due to research on vulnerable individuals or groups.


## Who is vulnerable?
Individuals may be considered vulnerable because they do not have the decision-making capacity to provide voluntary informed consent, as in the case of children or the cognitively impaired, or because of the situation they are in (such as, being incarcerated or institutionalized).

The following are examples of groups that are often considered vulnerable populations or in need of additional protections or considerations in research:

- Pregnant women
- Prisoners
- Racial or ethnic minorities
- Human fetuses
- Institutionalized persons (for example, persons in correctional facilities, nursing homes, or mental health facilities)
- Neonates
- Children
- Individuals with physical disabilities
- Socially disadvantaged
- Economically disadvantaged
- Individuals with mental disabilities or cognitive impairments
- Terminally ill or very sick

These groups require additional consideration and/or protections. Some groups may be considered vulnerable because they may not be able to make informed decisions for themselves, they may be in situations in which they can easily be manipulated, or they may be a convenient and readily available study population

## Vulnerable to what?
Before examining the details of certain groups, it is important to understand what one means by the term "vulnerability" as it relates to research. Historically, those who are vulnerable have been subjected to one or more of these four common types of abuses in human research. 

- Physical control : Subjects who are physically forced to participate in research. This represents a complete lack of voluntariness. When subjects have no choice about whether or not to participate in research and are under the complete physical control of the researchers
- Coercion : The use of a credible threat of harm or force to control another person. This also represents a lack of voluntariness.
- Undue influence : The misuse of a position of confidence or power to lead or influence others to make a decision that they would not otherwise make
- Manipulation : The deliverate design and management of conditions or information intended to lead subjects to make a decision that they would not otherwise make. Examples are lying about information, witholding information, or exaggerating information.

These abuses exist along a continuum of severity with physical control being the most severe and undue influence and manipulation being the least severe. However, none of these types of abuses are appropriate in the context of research on human subjects. 

These four abuses can give rise to exploitation, or the action of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from them in some way.

In the context of research, manipulation might be treating subjects in an unfair way in order to benefit from their participation in the research and using the individual subject merely as a means to conduct the research. 

## Sources of Vulnerability: Intrinsic Factors and attributes

Historically, sources of vulnerability are based on an intrinsic factor of an individual or group. This way of understanding sources of vulnerability has affected how the different guidance documents and regulations are written. 

- International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice E6 guideline, section 1.61 : "Individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical trial may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation, or of a retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate"
- The Belmont Report, Section B1 : "Some persons are in need of extensive protection, even to the point of excluding them from activities which may harm them... The extent of protection afforded should depend upon the risk of harm and the likelihood of benefit"
- Declaration of Helsinki, Paragraph 9 : "Some research populations are particularly vulnerable and need special protection. These include those who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence"
- Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, Commentary on guideline 15 : "It is important to recognize that vulnerability involves not only the ability to provide initial consent to participate in research, but also aspects of the ongoing participation in research studies. In some cases, persons are vulnerable because they are relatively (or absolutely) incapable of protecting their own interests... Although research ethics comittess can require special protections only for potential participants collectively for a particular project, researchers and others involved in research must take into account factors that render invidivual participants vulnerable and take appropriate steps to mitigate those factors"

## Sources of Vulnerability: Situational Considerations and/or Protections

Federal regulations have defined vulnerable populations using a group-based approach and specifically require additional protections for children; pregnany women, fetuses, and neonates; and prisoners

This method of classifying vulnerability does not account for situations in which an individual might be vulnerable (such as, someone who is acutely ill).

Additionally, the group-based classification of vulnerability does not adequately give attention to when an individual has multiple sources of vulnerability (such as, pregnant minors, individuals with mental illness who are also homeless, and other multiple-category individuals)

The NBAC provided an alternative way of thinking about and analyzing vulnerability.

The commission proposed a more nuanced definition of vulnerability in the context of research: "In general, persons are vulnerable in research either because they have difficulty providing voluntary, informed consent arising from limitations in decision-making capacity...or situational circumstances...or because they are especially at risk for exploitation"

The NBAC looked at characteristics individuals might have that would prevent them from being able to provide voluntary informed consent. The traits may be thought of as falling into six broad areas:

- Cognitive or Communicative vulnerability
- Institutional vulnerability
- Deferentical vulnerability
- Medical vulnerability
- Economic vulnerability
- Social vulnerability

### Cognitive or Communicative vulnerability
Prospective research subjects who are not able to comprehend information, contemplate, and make decisions about participation in a proposed reseaerch study have a cognitive or communicative vulnerability. This vulnerability may be thought of in three broad categories. In any of these situations, subjects may not be able to provide fully informed consent to participate in the research. 

- Capacity-related cognitive vulnerability : Subjects to some extent lack capacity to make informed choices. Examples might include young children or adults with cognitive impairments that affect decision-making.
- Situational cognitive vulnerability : Subjects do not lack capacity but are in situations that do not allow them to exercise their capacities effectively. Examples might include when a subject is distracted or during an emergency situation, such as an acute illness or injury.
- Communicative vulnerability : Subjects do not lack capacity, but due to limited ability to communicate with the researchers are not able to exercise their capacities effectively. Examples might include subjects who speak or read different languages than researchers do, or subjects who have speech impairments or difficulty reading. 

### Institutional vulnerability
Prospective subjects in research who are under the formal authority of others may have an institutional vulnerability. These individuals have the cognitive capacity to consent but may not be able to make a truly voluntary choice, and may be unduly influenced (or coerced) to participate when they otherwise might not have done so. Institutional vulnerability may arise when subjects are prisoners, enlistees in the military, employees, or college students. For example, college students may be required to participate to earn a higher grade. In these situations, informed consent may be compromised because it is not truly voluntary. Further, these individuals may be subject to exploitation because of their subordinate status.

### Deferential vulnerability
Deferential vulnerability is similar to institutional vulnerability, but the authority over the prospective subject is due to informal power relationships rather than formal hierarchies. The power relationship may be based on gender, race, or they can be based on inequalities in knowledge (such as in the doctor-patient relationship). Like institutional vulnerability, deferential vulnerability increases the risk of harm because informed consent would be compromised and not fully voluntary. 

### Medical vulnerability
Medical vulnerability arises when prospective subjects have serious health conditions for which there are no satisfactory standard treatments. Such subjects may not be able to adequately weigh the research's risks and potential benefits, and informed consent would therefore not be compromised by inadequate comprehension. Further, these subjects are at risk of exploitation because they may be augmented by the therapeutic misconception. When subjects blur the roles played by physician-researchers or fail to appreciate the differences between research and treatment, therapeutic misconception may augment medical vulnerability.

### Economic vulnerability
Economic vulnerability arises when prospective subjects are disadvantaged in the distributaion of social goods and services (such as income, housing, or healthcare). Participation in research offers the possibility of payment or attainment of healthcare or other services that are otherwise not available, and induces persons to enroll in a research study when it might be against their better judgement and when otherwise they would not do so. These inducements to enroll threaten the voluntary nature of consent and raise the danger of exploitation. 

### Social vulnerability
Prospective subjects who belong to undervalued social groups may be subject to social vulnerability. The perception that these groups are less valuable to society could lead to reduced concerns for risks and burdens on those groups and increase the risk of exploitation.

## How the regulations define and address vulnerability.

In the HHS regulation at 45 CFR 46, there are multiple places where vulnerable populations involved in research are either directly referenced or the reference is implies.

### IRB Membership (45 CFR 46.107)
The HHS regulations contain a number of specific mandates for IRB membership. These include a specific statement relating to vulnerable populations.

45 CFR 46.107(a) : If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a category of subjects that is vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, or individuals with impaired decision making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgable about and experianced in working with these categories of subjects.

This statement highlights the importance of specifically considering and providing additional protections and/or considerations for vulnerable populations participating in research. 

### Criteria for Approval (45 CFR 46.111)
In the portion of the HHS regulations that describes the necessary criteria for an IRB to approve research, the following two sections are relevant. 

#### 45 CFR 46.111 (a)(3)
Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impared decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.

#### 45 CFR 46.111 (b)
When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impared decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects

This specifically names a few categories of potentially vulnerable populations or groups requiring additional protections and/or considerations. Later in the regulations (in Subparts B, C, and D), three specific populations -- prisoners, pregnant women, and children -- and their additional protections are described in detail

## Types of vulnerability defined in the federal regulations
HHS at 45 CFR 46.111(b) provides the following list of examples of vulnerable populations

- Children
- Prisoners
- Individuals with impared decision-making capacity
- Economically or educationally disadvantaged persons

The HHS regulations have three subparts that discuss specific additional protections for identified vulnerable populations of individuals when they are going to participate in research. These subparts have been adopted, to varying extents, by some other federal agencies that have adopted the common rule (45 CFR 46, Subpart A).

Although not a common rule agency, the FDA provides a similar list of vulnerable subject examples at 21 CFR 56.111(b)

The following subparts are from the HHS regulations and provide additional protections for these populations in research. 

### Subpart B
Additional Protections for Pregnant women, Human fetuses, and Neonates involved in research (45 CFR 46.201-7) 

Embryos and fetuses are vulnerable because they have no capacity and are under the direct control of the mother. Though the regulations imply that the pregnant women herself is vulnerable (perhaps because of the unique dependant relationship with the fetus) not all commentators agree

### Subpart C
Additional Protections Pertaining to Biomedical and Behavioral Research Involving Prisoners as Subjects (45 CFR 46.301-6) 

Prisoners have their rights limited in some way. They may be subject to coercion because they are under direct control of the state to varying extents. They may also be subject to undue influence because they may see participation in research as a way to improve their existence in prison or to be eligible for parole. Prisoners may also live in situations that are markedly different from the rest of society, and they may be undervalued as a social group. Subjects who are prisoners are a convenience population, and by being incarcerated, they do not have the choice or ability to leave the prison. 

### Subpart D
Additional Protections for children involved as subjects in research (45 CFR 46.401-9) 

Children have a wide range of capacities based on age, developmental stage, maturity, and psychological state. They may be vulnerable to control, coercion, undue influence, and manipulation by others (for example, parents or guardians, researchers, teachers, and others). Due to their age, children may face legal limitaions (for example, not lawfully able to leave home, seek employment, or make their own medical decisions), because they are not legally able to make their own decisions until they reach the age of majority in many circumstance.

### Legally Authorized Representative
When a subject cannot consent, researchers may obtain consent from a LAR when appropriate. The HHS regulations define LAR as "an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject's participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research".

The HHS regulations allow for institutional policy that recognizes an appropriate LAR in the nonresearch context to also apply in the research context if there is no applicable law that defines a LAR for the research context.

## An expanded view of vulnerability: Examples of additional vulnerabilities not explicitly covered by the federal regulations
Despite not being specifically identified in the regulations, various individuals, groups, or situations that may render individuals vulnerable in the context of research, may require specific additional protections. The following are some examples that are important to understand and consider when thinking about research involving vulnerable populations or those requiring additional protections and/or considerations

### Vulnerability due to Critical Illness
Vulnerability for the group of critically ill individuals and in the situation of emergency research may be due to intrinsic factors (like altered decision-making capacity and reduced capacity to consent) and situational factors (like coercive settings or undue influence and inducements).

Critically ill individuals may have limitations in their ability to process information, make complex decisions, and communicate their wishes. This may lead to them being in a state of diminished capacity to make autonomous decisions and protect their own interests.

Even if potential subjects are able to understand and communicate their wishes, the voluntariness of their decision can be affected by situational factors, such as those present in emergency research. If the treating physician also occupies the role of researcher, this may unduly influence an individual's willingness to participate in research

### Vulnerability due to Terminal Illness (Research at the End-of-Life)
Persons at the end-of-life may be vulnerable for numerous reasons, including cognitive and physical impairments, that may progress as death approaches. 

Threats to voluntariness may arise as a result of an often disperate desire for relief from pain and suffering, presenting the risk of exploitation. Desire to please caregivers may be particularly prominent. In addition, the risks and benefits that are important to patients near the end-of-life may be much more difficult to define. In orther words, an individual's goals and perceptions of burden and risk may change substantially when nearing death

### Vulnerability due to Decisional Impairment
It is important to recognize that decisional impairment can result from a variety of intrinsic factors and situational conditions and is not limited to individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis. Decisional impairment exists along a spectrum and therefore must be assessed in the context of the information that must be understood and the nature of the decisions to be made.

Decisional impairment can result from many causes including stroke and other CNS disorders, trauma, medical treatment, and substance abuse. In a number of cases, decisional impairment can result from a documented disability that is protected under the ADA

Decisional impairment is often compounded by situational factors that limit reedom of choice and the ability to understand the nature and consequences of research participation. Some examples include 

- Stigma
- Lack of or insufficient healthcare insurance coverage
- Under-education
- Discrimination
- Institutionalization
- Homelessness
- Inadequate access to housing

### Vulnerability due to Physical Disabilities or Impairments
Physical disabilities and impairments can result in diminished participation in society because the disability limits a major life activity. The diminished participation in society can lead to vulnerability both because of an intrinsic factor (such as a physical limitation the individual experiences) or a situational factor (such as, a lack of an adequate accomodation for the disability allowing fo full participation)

Intrinsic factors such as a limitation in one of the senses (like sight) can lead to a very strond desire to participate in research that may have the prospect of direct benefit to the subject. This may potentially lead to undue influence. Additionally, situational factors in the study design can lead to vulnerability. For example, not providing a large-print or Braille consent form to an individual who is visually impaired or blind can interfere with the voluntariness of consent.

### Vulnerability due to Economic Disadvantage or Socail Marginalization
Economically disadvantaged individuals are those who under-resourced to provide for themselves or their families, and experience particular hardships due to disparities and inequalities in the society in which they live. These situational factors can affect or limit the subject's voluntariness to participate in research. 

Socially marginalized individuals are those who lack influence or standing in society for a socially constructed reason (such as race, religion, or disease state). Individuals who are socially marginalized often lack adequate access to social organizations such as the legal system.

The potential for undue influence or manipulation is higher for these subjects. For example, the prospect of getting monetary compensation for participation in the research could significantly affect the willingness to participate, influencing the subject to accept greater risks of harm than they would otherwise affect. Economically disadvantaged individuals may also enroll in health research because it could mean access to healthcare where they may not otherwise have access. 

### Vulnerability due to Social Hierarchy
Hierarchical social structures are found in situations throughout society. Examples include hospitalized individuals, nursing home residents, students, employees, prisoners, soldiers, other military personel, or in some cases ethnic groups (such as indigenous populations)

Hierarchical structures have the potential to create issues centered around power, control, coercion, undue influence, and manipulation. The "higher" hierarchical individual has the ability to exercise power or control over others (subordinates) in some way that is either real or perceived. Examples include:

1. Program directors seeking enrollment in research from residents they directly supervise
2. Faculty members recruiting students they currently teach
3. Commanding officers seeking enrollment in research from soldiers or military personnel that report to them through a chain of command

### Vulnerability due to Sexual or Gender Minority Status
"Sexual and gender minority" is an umbrella phrase that encompasses lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender populations as well as those whose sexual orientation, gender identity, and expressions, or reproductive development varies from traditional, societal, cultural, or physiological norms. Members of SGM communities have been vulnerable to discrimination, bullying, violence, and prejudice. Gender differences in societal structures may render individuals and groups vulnerable. 

SGM individuals face social and cultural vulnerabilities because many have experianced some forms of prejudice and discrimination at home, school, work, and/or other social contexts or organizations due to their sexual orientation.

Gender differences may also make some individuals vulnerable, especially in areas of the world where women do not have the basic rights of citizenship (for example, access to education, the right to divorce, and the right to vote). These vulnerabilities can lead to increased risks of harm to the individuals in their participation in research, and the prospect of undue influence or manipulation.

The principle of beneficence or "do no harm" is particularly important in SGM research. Social and behavioral researchers must be cognizant of potential harm that could be associated with study participation and institute safeguards to minimize potential risks of harm when conducting research with SGM subjects experiancing additional vulnerabilities. 

### Vulnerability due to Uncertain Immigration Status and Individuals involved in Illegal Activities
Individuals or groups of people who are regarded as being involved in illegal activities or are undocumented immigrants may be vulnerable because of the potential consequences that exposure may have to them. This can include risks of retaliation against them by others and legal consequences.

The risks of harm are higher with these individuals and can often indlude group-based risks of harm, such as negative public health consequences that result from violating trust. For example, if undocumented consequences that result from violating trust. For example, if undocumented individuals or those involved in illegal activities fear that they will be exposed when seeking medical care, they may not seek medical care. This can result in negative public health consequences for that group of individuals. 

## Research ethics implications
The three pillars often described in research ethics are important to examine in the context of vulnerable individuals or groups participating in research. A combination of intrinsic factors and situational conditions that lead to vulnerability also open up the individual or group to potential problems that interfere with one of the pillars, requiring attention by an IRB and potentially additional safeguards

### Respect for persons
There is the possibility that due to intrinsic factors or situational conditions individuals or groups can be open to coercion or undue influence. The national commission asserts that coercion occors when one person intentionally presents an overt threat of harm in order to obtain compliance. An example is a professor telling students "participate in my research or you will fail the class". Similarly, a physician threatening to abandon a patient who refuses to participate in a study represents coercion. However, the national commision's definition may be too narrow, as coercion need not be overt. For example, a patient who participates in a study run by her primary care physician, because the patient fears her care is contingent on participation, is reacting to fear of retribution (coercion) (whether the physician intends this or not).

Inducements, in contrast, are offers that influence people to make decisions, or do things they would not otherwise do. Inducements and the influence they cause may be acceptable or they may be "undue". The distinction is not always clear or universally agreed upon. Offering $10 USD may be acceptable for an hour-long research study; offering $1000 USD, or a better grade in a class, is probably not appropriate. In general, inducements constitute an undue influence if they alter a potential subject's decision-making process such that they do not appropriately consider the resercher's risk-benefit relationship.

Misunderstanding of the research is also a problem that can interfere with autonomous decision-making. For individuals or groups who are vulnerable, the prospect of direct benefit, whether real or perceived, can dramatically affect the individual's voluntariness. This can lead to a person accepting a much higher level of risk of harm than they otherwise would accept or subscribing to the false belief that the research may hold out the prospect for direct benefit to them. 

### Beneficence
The concept of beneficence in research includes weighing the research's risk of harm against the benefits. When conducting research involving vulnerable individuals or groups, two issues arise related to the risks of harm.

1. There may be changes in magnitude of an already identified risk of harm due to the vulnerability expressed by the individual or group. 

2. There may be previously unrecognized risks of harm that arise because of the vulnerability experianced by the individual or group.

### Justice
There are three issues that arise when considering issues of justice in research involving vulnerable individuals or groups. 

First, in some types of research, a vulnerable group may be the primary group on which the research is conducted because investigation is focused on the source of vulnerability. This means that the research burden is heaviest on the group based solely on the presence of their vulnerability. This also could mean that htose who experience this vulnerability may be the primary beneficiaries of the research results. According to the concept of justice in the Belmont Report, research with a vulnerable group may be acceptable. 

Second, some vulnerable individuals or groups may become the study focus merely for ease or convenience of access. Vulnerable individuals or groups may also be undervalued, so risks of harm or burdens to them are trivialized. This is a significant issue and should be monitored carefully. There are historical cases of prisoners or wards of the state being studied because of convenience when there were more appropriate study groups to enroll. This was the case for poth the Jewish Chronic Disease case and the Willowbrook case. In these instances, researchers enrolled populations that were both undervalued by society and convenient for them to study. 

Finally, the third issue related to justice involves study design. Designing studies to exclude individuals or vulnerable groups from the research becuase of the complications and additional requirements for studying them is problematic (either real or percieved). In this case, the lack of inclusion hurts the ability to advance understanding and the underlying science and denies the group the potential benefit of research.

## Guidance for IRBs and Reviewers
The breadth of the expanded view of vulnerability described here and the complications involved with adhering to the regulations, combined with a common sense approach to try to protect subjects, result in increased difficulty in an IRB's review of research. Therefore, a stepwise approach to consideration of the research proposal may be helpful.

### Are subjects vulnerable?
It is important to ask researchers to fully describe the population to be studied and the situations in which the potential research subjects find themselves. This should answer both the question about the intrinsic factors or attributes, as well as the situational forces that may give rise to different types of vulnerability. It will also help the IRB and researchers quickly identify if there are any regulations that must be applied. Researchers generally have a much clearer understanding of the circumstances and potential challenges their research subjects face. They are in a unique position to share their insight. When IRBs request this information, it facilitates the review of research and in the best circumstances leads to better designed research studies, improved review of research, and better protection of human subjects.

Researchers and IRBs should consider:

- Is there a power differential between researchers and subjects?
- Are there potential excessive motivating factors for subjects?
- Are there potential communcation issues for subjects?
- Are there potential decisional issues for subjects?
- Is the recruitment process acceptable?
- Are advertisements acceptable?
- Are there economic issues that might affect the acceptability of payment arrangements?

### Is inclusion of vulnerable subjects appropriate?
As discussed previously, if some potential subjects are vulnerable, the IRB must then decide if inclusion of this population is indeed appropriate. The IRB must consider the competing ethical imperatives of respect for persons (especially protection of persons who lack self-determination and require protection). beneficence, and justice (offering a fair opportunity to benefit from participation).

### Are vulnerable subjects adequately protected?
If the inclusion of vulnerable subjects is appropriate, does the research plan (including subject identification, recruitment, and consent) minimize the possiblity of coercion, undue influence, manipulation, and exploitation? Meanwhile, does the research plan maximize the likelihood of valid informed consent? At the very minimum, is the process of informed consent valid? That is, is information presented in an understandable manner, do subjects comprehend the details of the research and their rights as research subjects, and is the process of consent conducive to true voluntariness?

Many of the previously noted questions are still relevant. In addition, researchers and IRBs should consider:

- Are there reasonable accommodations provided for subjects who may be disabled?
- Is information presented to subjects in an understandable and accessible manner?
- Do subjects comprehend the research details and their rights as research subjects?
- Is the consent process conducive to true voluntariness?
- Who is involved in the consent process?
- Can subjects consent for themselves?
- Do the vulnerabilities of the subjects require the additional protections of a research subject advocate?

It is important to remember the review process described here is an iterative process. Adequate protections may not allow inclusion of a population previously considered too vulnerable, or indeed may make a population not vulnerable at all.

## Case Study
Consider the following research plans:

- A phase II study of an investigational drug for depression that offers monetary compensation. Target subject population is inhabitants of a homeless shelter who have moderate to severe depression.
- A survey of underage drinking among first year college students. Target subject population is students enrolled in a required "Introduction to Psychology" class.
- A series of interviews of new Somali immigrants who are not fluent in English, regarding difficulties that they may have encountered in seeking employment and whether community services and family support have influenced the transition to life in the new environment.
- A study of gene expression levels in atheroma (deposits of lipid-containing accumulations on the innermost layer of the wall of an artery) of patients undergoing emergency coronary artery catheterization and balloon angioplasty. Material used is tissue obtained at the time of the clinically indicated procedure, which would be discarded anyway. No extra material is obtained and no additional procedures are performed.

Which of the preceding research plans may involve a potentially vulnerable population or vulnerable subjects, and why?

Each of these research plans illustrate a concept of vulnerability. In addition to the Belmont report, federal regulations, ICH E6, and other guidance, the NBAC in 2001 noted, "In general, persons are vulnerable in research either because they have difficulty providing voluntary, informed consent arising from limitations in decision-making capacity...or situational circumstances...or because they are especially at risk for exploitation."

Although the federal regulations have not prescribed additional protections for these groups as they do for pregnant women, prisoners, and children, the regulations require additional safeguards when some or all of the subjects are vulnerable to undue influence or coercion.

The NBAC provides an analytic approach to vulnerability, which acknowledges both that vulnerability is situational (as opposed to group-based), and that there may be multiple conditions leading to vulnerability for an individual person or group.

Examinimng each case:
Homeless individuals with depression are certainly economically vulnerable, as they may feel compelled to participate in research to earn money for basic living expenses. They might be unduly influenced by the expectation that the investigational drug may treat their medical condition or that they will receive free medical care. They would also be vulnerable because of the depression, not just economic vulnerability.

First year college students have the capacity to make decisions themselves; however, they are subject to formal authority of others like their professors or to organizational requirements for completing a course or degree. The student-teacher relationship and the hierarchical structure may affect the student's ability to make free choices. 

Non-English speaking immigrants may not have the ability to understand and process information if communications are only in English. Some immigrants may be economically disadvantaged, which may contribute to their vulnerability. Some may have their choice to participate, or not, influenced by social or cultural factors.

Some potential subjects in the final scenario may not be a group typically considered "vulnerable." Some individuals may be well-educated, affluent, knowledgable about research, and have the ability to make decisions. However, the life threatening stressful situation may not allow them to exercise their full decision-making ability. They may be frightened, in pain, and want to please the physician-researcher taking care of them. This situational vulnerability may lead them to make decisions they might not otherwise make. 

## Summary
Vulnerability may be considered in terms of categories (children, fetuses, persons who are cognitively impaired, persons who are economically disadvantaged, and so on) based on intrinsic characteristics of group members. The NBAC proposed a more nuanced description as persons "who have difficulty providing voluntary, informed consent arising from limitations in decision-making capacity...or situational circumstances...or because they are especially at risk for exploitation" and classified vulnerabilities more broadly as cognitive or communicative, institutional, deferential, medical, economic, or social.

Considering this broader NBAC view, many more types of vulnerability can be recognized as having difficulty providing informed consent or being at risk for exploitation. 

These vulnerabilities ultimately relate to challenges to the ethical principles underlying human subjects research:

- Respect for persons
- Beneficence
- Justice

Researchers and IRBs must carefully consider characteristics of the subject populations and situational factors to determine if there are potential vulnerabilities, and if so, whether there is adequate justification to include these persons in the research and what additional protections may be required. Regarding this last consideration, researchers and IRBs must consider the risk of harm to individual subjects and populations if they are excluded from participation.

It is important for researchers and IRBs to evaluate the selection of subjects, taking into consideration the purpose of the research and the setting in which it take place. They must examine the risks of harm and benefits to vulnerable populations included in research and endure that provisions to protect them are in place.
