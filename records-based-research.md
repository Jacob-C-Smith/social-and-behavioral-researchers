# Records based research
Researchers can make important advances in the fields of education, medicine, psychology, and public policy without any in-person interaction with human subjects. Rather, hypotheses can be posted and answered by analyzing documented information in various types of parper or electronic records (such as medical, motor vehicle, criminal justice, or school records).

Each person conducting scientific research based on records should:

1. Understand the specific risks to human subjects associated with such research
2. Ensure that the research plan specifies procedures that minimize those risks.
3. Obrain all required approvals (organizational, state, federal, and international, if applicable) before conducting the research.

Before collecting information from records for research purposes, a researcher should consult with:

 - The IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) at his/her organization to determine the type of review required (if any)
 - The applicable administrator at the organization where the actual records are owned or maintained to ensure the ability to access them for research purposes. 

In addition, the researcher needs to determine if there are any other regulations affecting the record-review. Examples include HIPAA's privacy rule for medical records research, or the FERPA for student education records

## Risks of records-based research
Risks associated with records-based research stem from possible invasion of privacy and breaches of confidentiality.

For example, the possibility that disclosure of the information could reasonably place the subject at risk of criminal or civil liability and/or damage the subject's financial standing, employability, or reputation.

- Privacy : Privacy can be defined in terms of having control over the extent, timing, and circumstances of sharing oneself (physically, behaviorally, or intellectually) or information about oneself with others

In the context of research, privacy risk pertains primarily to the methods used to obtain information about subjects. Privacy risks are very low when subjects actually consent to provide personal information. However, privacy risks are much higher when researchers obtain information for research purposes without the subjects' consent, which is often the case in records-based research. 

- Confidentiality : Confidentiality pertains to the actual handling of the personal information one it is obtained. 

In other words, now that the researcher has obtained private information, how will it be used, stored, and reported in a way that is consistent with the manner under which it was originally obtained from the individual? Information from public records and information obtained under a relationship of trust, as in the doctor-patient relationship, will require different considerations for protecting confidentialiy. 

Records-based research must balance the possible benefits of answering important research questions with the possible risks of using information about individuals, especially if information is used without their consent. Information about individuals should be protected from disclosure because of the potential risks of harm when shared inappropriately. 

For instance, individuals may provide certain information about drug addiction or mental illness to their medical doctors. However, they may experience certain consequences if this information were revealed to law enforcement officials or their employers. The IRB/IEC carefully reviews the procedures that are described by the researcher to protect the confidentiality of the information being accessed, including identification of all individuals or groups who may also be able to access that information. For example, a university's audit office or a research sponsor may require access to the information to ensure that the research activity is being conducted appropriately. 

## Minimizing Risks
There is an ethical and regulatory responsibility to minimize research risks to human subjects. The risks of invasion of privacy can be minimized by obtaining informed consent from subjects. However, for a variety of reasons, obtaining informed consent may be impracticable, may compromise the goal of the research, or may actually put the subject at greater risk. 

In these circumstances, the IRB/IEC may waive the necessity for informed consent if specific regulatory criteria at 45 CFR 46.116(f)(3) are met:

1. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;
2. The research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration;
3. If the research involves using identifiable private information, the research could not practicably be carried out without using such information in an identifiable format;
4. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects;
5. Whenever appropriate, the subjects or LARs will not provide with pertinent information after participation

The risks of breach of confidentiality associated with records-based research are necessarily tied to the sensitivity of the requested information. If the information is recorded without identifiers, the sensitivity of the information is less of a concern. If the information is both identifiable and sensitive, methods to protect confidentiality must be carefully considered by the researcher and approved by the IRB/IEC.

Therefore, in considering the research hypothesis, the researcher must assess how important it is to be able to associate the individual with his/her information. 

Whevener possible, and to the greatest extent possible, only de-identified or anonymous information should be recorded. Assuming the research cannot be conducted anonymously, the following questions speak to protection of the collected information. Based on a researcher's answers, an IRB/IEC will carefully assess whether possible rsisk from breaches of condifentiality have been minimized:

1. What kind of identifiable information, if any, will be collected?
2. Who will have access to the identifiable information?
3. Where will the identifiable information be kept?
4. What kinds of codes or encryption will be used to separate research data from subject identifiers?
5. How will limitations on access be ensured?
6. How will research staff be trained about privacy and confidentiality?
7. How long will identitiable information or linkages to personal identifiers be kept?
8. For data being transmitted physically and/or electronically, what encryption methods will be used?
9. What procedures will be used for disposal/destruction of identifiers and research documents, once no longer required?

### Certificate of Confidentiality
Researchers may obtain additional protection for certain research data by recieving a study-specific Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH. 

Specifically, the research data in question must constitute identifiable, sensitive information, which is defined as "information that is about an individual and that is gathered or used during the course of biomedical, behavioral, clinical, or other research and:

1. Through which an individual is identified; or
2. For which there is at least a very small risk, as determined by current scientific practices or statistical methods, that some combination of the information, a request for the information, and other available data sources could be used to deduce the identity of an individual.

Once issued, a CoC prohibits disclosure of research data by the researcher if requested to do so through civil, criminal, and other types of legal proceedings, and also prohibits disclosure to any other person not connected with the research, unless certain conditions are met (for example, request is made with consent of the subject.)

If a study is funded by the NIH, the issuance of a CoC is automatic. If a study is not funded by NIH, the issuance of a CoC depends on a successful application to the funding agency.

## What type of review is required for records-based research
Records-based research can fall into one of four review types. To identify the appropriate type of review, consider the sequence of the following four questions:

- Do the activivities meet the federal definition of "human subjects research?" If yes:
- Is the research eligable for exemption from the federal regulations? If no:
- Is the research eligible for expidited review under the federal regulations? If no:
- Does the records-based research need review by the full/convened IRB/IEC? Must be a yes!

### Do the activivities meet the federal definition of "human subjects research?"
To determine if an activity constitutes human subjects research, one must break out the individual definitions of "research" and "human subject". 

Records based reseaerch activities may not meet the federal definition of "human subjects research". HHS regulations at 45 CFR 46 define a human subject as "a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research:

- Obtaains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; or
- Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens."

According to the regulations, research is defined as "a systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.

Human subject + Research = Human research subject. 

To determine if the proposed records-based project meets the regulatory definition of humnan subjects research, the individual designated by the organization to make this decision will consider:

- Do the records involve living individuals?
- Were the records collected specifically for this research project through intervention or interaction with the individual?
- Can the researcher readily ascertain the identity of any of the individuals either directly or indirectly through coding systems?

The common rule specifically excludes certain activities from the definition or research:

- Scholarly or journalistic activities
- Public health surveilance activities
- Criminal justice activities (collection and analysis of information, biospecimens, or records) conducted for criminal justice purposes
- Authorized operational activities in support of intelligence, homeland security, defense, or other national security missions.

The researcher should check with the IRB/IEC to determine who has the authority to make this decision, whether the research constitutes human subjects research, or whether the organization's policy is more stringent. 

If the research involves coded private information, refer to OHRP [Guidance on Research Using Coded Private Information or Specimens](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/research-involving-coded-private-information/index.html)

### Is the research eligable for exemption from the federal regulations?
If an activity constitutes human subjects research, it may be exempt from federal regulations.

Records-based research may be exempt if any of the followin apply:

- The identifiable private information is publicly available
- The information is recorded by the researcher in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified (directly or through identifiers linked to subjects). Although the researcher may actually see identifiers while reviewing the data set, he/she cannot record any of them in any research record or data collection instrument. The researcher also does not contact the subjects and will not re-identify the subjects.
- The research involves only information collection and analysis for the purposes of "health care operations" or "research" (as defined at 45 CFR 164.501) or "public health activities and purposes" (as described at 45 CFR 164.512(b))
- The research is conducted by, or on behalf of a federal department or agency using government-generated or government-collected information obtained for non-research activities.
- The identifiable private information is being used for secondary research in which broad consent was obtained and documented for the identifiable private information for secondary research; a waiver of documentation of informed consent was obtained; or an IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determination that the secondary research is within the scope of the broad consent and the research does not include returning individual research results to subjects (unless legally required).

OHRP recommeds that researchers do not determine if their research qualifies as exempt. Rather, the organization should designate an applicable institutional official (or the IRB/IEC) to conduct this review. Organizations may have internal rules and policies in addition to the federal regulations that will determine whether to grant the exemption. 

### Is the research eligible for expidited review under the federal regulations?
If the records review activity constitutes human subjects research, and does not qualify for exemption, it will then be subject to federal regulations. 

Records-based research may qualify for expedited review if the research activity:
- Poses no more than minimal risk of harm or discomfort to the subjects; and
- Is described in one of the expedited review categories
  - Records-based research that is eligible for expedited review generally falls under Category 5, "Research involving materials (data, documents, records, or specimens) that have been collected, or will be collected soley for nonresearch purposes (such as medical treatment or diagnosis)".
  - Expedited Category 5 applies to prospective as well as retrospective research

### Does the records-based research need review by the full/convened IRB/IEC? 
If the human subjects research does not qualify for exemption or expedited review, then it must undergo full review by the IRB/IEC at a convened meeting.

## When health information is involved: HIPAA
When records-based research requires access to individually identifiable ("protected") health information (also refered to as PHI), additional requirements of HIPAA must be met. This includes the need for written authorization from the patient above and beyond informed consent requirements under the common rule.

Promulgated through the Office of Civil Rights, requirements under HIPAA vary depending on the type and number of identifiers that are being associated with the accessed health information. 

If most, but not all, mandated identifiers are removed this is called a "limited data set." Written patient authorization may not be required for research using limited data sets, provided there is a data use agreement between the researcher and the organization holding the medical records. 

If any more identifiers are added to the set, either written patient authorizaion is required, or a HIPAA Privacy Board can grant a waiver of authorization based on similar criteria to those required for waiver of consent under 45 CFR 46. Health information that is completely "de-identified" as defined under HIPAA, is not subject to the privacy law.

## When school records are involved: FERPA
FERPA is a federal law that applies to educational records and control over how this information is disclosed to third parties. FERPA applies to any educational organization that receives funds from  programs administered by the US Department of Education. This includes K-12 schools and postsecondary institutions. There may be instances when a records-based research study is exempt from human subjects research regulations, but must comply with FERPA. Researchers should be aware of FERPA, so they may comply with it if conducting research with educational records. 

## Summary
Although there is no direct interaction with human subjects in records-based research, there may be risks to those individuals who originally provided the information used in such activities. Those risks must be minimized, informed consent must be considered, and review and approval from the organization and the IRB/IEC must be obtained per local, state, and federal regulations. Research involving identifiable health information requires compliance with additional federal requirements.
