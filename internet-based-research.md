# Internet-Based Research
Today more than ever, researchers are using the internet to do resaerch -- both as a rsearch tool and as the objects of study.

Let us consider some of the ways the internet can be used in research. 

- Allows researhcers to conduct survey research without the expense associated wit hmailed or in-person surveys.
- Facilitates the process of recruiting groups of subjects from a very large pool of individuals with characteristics or experiances that may be difficult to find in local communities. For example, developing mobile internet technologies and social media applications allow researchers to research a wider and younger audience using mobile phones.
- Provides a way to pre-screen subjects.
- Allows its users to be the subjects of study including linguistic analysis of online communication and the internet as a social environment.
- Provides the opportunity to observe communications among individuals and to code and analyze an extensive range of phenomena, such as the use of online support groups, the decision-making behaviors of online consumers, or the adoption of new technologies. 

However, researchers must deal with ethical issues unique to the internet environment. These issues, such as the difficulty of confirming the adult status of online subjects, the "personhood" of pseudonymous online identities, and the potential re-identification of de-identified data, do not have ready solutions.

When using social media sites or platforms for online communities, researchers first should confirm their proposed study would not violate the sites or platforms ToS. Similarly, when using online research tools and services, such as online survey builders or automated speech-to-text transcriptions, researchers must become familiar with the privacy and confidentiality policies offered by the companies to ensure they are adequately protective.

Researchers must become conversant with new technologies, particularly when sensitive information must be safeguarded, which is critical given the ever-evolving landscape of living in a world where so much of our day-to-day takes place virtually.

This module will raise some issues for discussion and offer guidelines for protecting subjects and data in consideration of emerging technologies and the rapidly evolving use casees of the internet

## The internet as a Research Tool and as the Object of Study
Researchers can use the internet to conduct research with human subjects in two ways. 

### Use the internet as a research tool
Researchers may use the internet to help them conduct their studies. 

The following examples demonstrate how the internet is being used as a research tool:
 
 - Distributing an instrument via email or hosting a web-based survey on an onlive survey provider, such as Qualtrics
 - Advertising their studies on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram
 - Recruiting from online subject panels, such as those provided by companies like ClearVoice, Profilic, and Survey Sampling International
 - Conducting online interviews with subjects over video-conferencing platforms, like Zoom or Skype or instant messaging
 - Facilitating online focus groups in private chat rooms or VoIP calls
 - Providing information to subjects about the study procedures through vidoe hosting platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo
 - Posting online experiments or interventions on services such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT), which allows researchers to offer "workers" (or subjects) the ability to take part in human intelligence tasks (HITs) for compensation

### Use the internet as an environment to study human behavior
Researchers may use the internet as a research setting in which they merely observe people's online behavior, often requiring little or no interaction with the subjects.

The following examples demonstrate how the internet is being used as a research environment

- Studying behavior in online support groups
- Observing individuals in online communities, such as public forums like Reddit and Discords, or MMORPGs, such as Second Life and World of Warcraft
- Analyzing public Twitter posts and interactions or posts on social media
- Purchasing data sets or accessing publicly available data sets from data repositories

Researchers also can use computer programs to extract information from people's profiles on social networking websites or online communities. This method of  data collection is known as "data scraping". Although data scraping may provide rsearchers with a wealth of useful data with little effort, it presents several ethical issues that require consideration regarding informed consent, data security, and privacy.

## Internet-Based Research: Applying the Federal Regulations and ethical principles
The federal regulations and ethical principles should be applied to internet-based research.

### Applying the federal regulations of research with human subjects to internet-based research
According to 45 CFR 46, Subpart A, "human subject" and "research" are defined separately. 

However, both definitions must be met in order to qualify as human subjects research, which is a systematic investigation (intent to contribute to generalizable knowledge) involving living individuals about whom a researcher conducting research obtains information through intervention or interaction with the individual, ans uses, studies, or analyzes the information or obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information.

#### Living individuals
Asking subjects to complete an online survey or studying behavior in an online support group would meet the definition of research with human subjects because there are live humans about whom information is being collected and the researcher is interacting or intervening with them.

However, determining if you are collecting information about or interacting with "live human beings" may not always be clear in internet-based research. 

For example, suppose a resarcher wants to study avatars in virtual worlds. Avatars are characters that represent a "real world" user online, such as MMORPGs or online communities, and are used to interact and engage with the virtual world. Users can generally customize the physical appearance of their avatars, as well as their avatars' personality and character information. On some online platforms, it is understood that the information making up an avatar's character is fictional, such as avatars on the MMORPGs World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV. However, on some online platforms, such as web forums and groups, it may not be clear.

Furthermore, researchers need to be aware that online landscapes may also make use of NPCs. Although NPCs may look like an avatar, and in some instances be considered a "virtual human", they are not avatars because they are designed and controlled by a computer through AI.

If you obtain consent from an avatar, does the avatar become a human subject, by default, because it is controlled by a human? Do you need to obtain consent to use an avatar's information even if it is likely to not be representative of the human user?

There is also evidence suggesting the way in which researchers use their own avatars could affect how the individuals are interacting with it in the virtual world not only percieve others but themselves as well.

#### Interacting/Intervening
As already noted, there are several ways in which researchers can use the internet as a research tool or the object of study.

Generally, when researchers actively engage and interact with individuals online to collect data, it is likely that they are using the internet as a research tool. Conversely, if researchers collect data from individuals by merely observing the way people interact or behave online, it is likely they are using the internet as the object of study. But the degree to which researchers interact and intervene with subjects also may vary. 

Determining how the data are colected may help guide other aspects of the study's implementation, such as informed consent, privacy, and confidentiality protections. For example, the way subjects consent to an online survey is not the same way they consent to a Zoom interview. Similarly, the way reserachers apply privacy and confidentiality protections will differ if the information collected is from a private online support group or from a public blog.

#### Private Information
According to the common rule, private information is information that an individual can reasonably expect will not be observed or recorded. In internet-based research, issues about private information usually pertains to using the internet as a research setting. 

One method to determine whether consent on a webpage is public or private is to consider how a researcher can access the material. If the material could be accessed only by registering an account an logging in, then one could argue that the content on that page is private; whereas any material that could be accessed without an account or by logging in, could be considered public. However, this method may not be applicable to all websites or services. 

For example, some websites (such as Instagram or the online music search engine Grooveshark) allow users to access their content for a limited time, or up to a certain number of "hits", or a number of requests to view or access a file or page. After users have reached the site's threshold, the site might ask or require users to log in to continue accessing content. Do websites with these types of limitations provide researchers with information that is considered public or private?

Another method to consider is what the users' expectations are about the privacy of their online behavior

People use the internet to share information about themselves everyday through many platforms.

Users of these sites and services can share identifiable information about themselves, such as their full legal names, birthdates, email addresses, GPS coordinates, job titles, and employers. However, users may not know or lose sight of the fact that information shared may be public by virtue of it being posted on the internet. What responsibilities do researchers have in determining their subjects' expectations of privacy?

If it is reasonable to expect that some individually identifiable information available online is public rather than private, collection of that information may be compared to collecting information about people from a local newspaper. IRB review would not be required in this case because there is no expectation that the information published about us in newspapers is private. However, individuals may have privacy expectations that are at odds with the technology they are using. For example, people in online support groups may consider their communcations withing the group to be private even if the group is publicly accessable. Their expectation may be that their communications within the group are not to be observed and recorded for purposes such as marketing and research. This expectation is not consistent with the reality that many online support groups are public and that millions of people can access these groups' online communications.

Users of social networking sites, such as Facebook or Twitter, may or may not understand the privacy settings available to them. On the oneh hand, they may post information quite publicly while assuming their information is private. On the other hand, users may have a thorough understanding of the privacy settings they apply to their profiles, but fail to realize that the site could change the privacy settings outlined in its ToS without notice unless required by law. Still, even the savviest of users may delete their accounts and request the removal of all their information without understanding that third parties and search engines could retain copies of their information while their account had been active. 

Do researchers have any obligations to naive users of these kinds of sites when assessing what is a reasonable expectation of privacy?

Researchers and their IRBs or research ethics boards should both take an interest in understanding subjects' privacy expectations and third parties' policies, and user agreements or ToS to ensure subjects are adequately informed and protected in research.

#### Individually Identifying Information
Protecting subjects' privacy as well as the confidentiality of identifiable study data requires considering the ways people identify themselves when using the internet. For example, individuals internet identities may be very different from their "real" (or offline) identities. Although researchers may not use a subject's real name, that subject's online username may serve as that subject's internet identity. In this scenario, a subject's online name is considered a direct identifier. Similarly, if a researcher reports on the features and attributes of an individual's avatar (for example, the race, job classification, and ranking), this may indirectly identify the individual. Should researchers afford individuals online identities the same protection as their offline identities?

There are other re-identification methods unique to the internet. For example, direct quotes can be traced to a Twitter account without the user's handle. 

Participants identities may be "rendererd identifiable" if unique data points about them are "mined and matched" across different data sets, even if those same data points are not sufficiently identifiable on their own. These unique data points are often referred to as "indirect identifiers" or "partial identifiers". The way data are collected and transmitted online may make them vulnerable to inadvertent bearch in confidentiality. For example, data existing in a digital space can be retained indefinitely. Researchers may want to consider understanding the "data life cycle" on the most commonly used online research sites an tools. Presenting findings can also increase the likelihood of "re-identification by triangulation" if, for example, researchers propose to use graphics, such as a social networking map. Finally, information that may not seem sensitive or identifiable at the time of collection may become sensitive or identifiable, inadvertently, as technologtical advances help researchers link, combine, and analyze data.

One unique data point that could, conceivably, be used to re-identify someone is an IP address. There are several sites that provide users with instructions on how to trace an IP address in a matter of steps. Though it is not always possible to track down a specific individual using an IP address alone, HIPAA privacy rule considers IP addresses direct identifiers, as does the GDPR. Some online research service providers, such as Qualtrics, offer researchers the option to be given their data without an IP address as an added measure to protect the confidentiality and privacy of respondents.

### Applying ethical principles to internet-based research
Respecting the autonomy of subjects and minimizing potential risks of harm to subjects are ethical principles most relevant to internet-based research. 

#### How can researchers respect the autonomy of subjects in internet-based research?

Online consent form information:

The kind of information provided on an online consent form is identical to the kind of information provided on an offline consent form. This includes most, if not all, of the required elements of informed consent. For example, that participation is voluntary, the purpose of the research, procedures to follow and the expected duration of participatiopn, and any potential risks or benefits, a description of the extent, if any, to which the confidentiality of subjects' information will be maintained, and the researcher's contact information. A description of compensation also is important, if participants will be compensated. 

Documenting consent online is quite different from documenting consent in person. Documenting consent in person often consists of a signed form that researchers and subjects keep in their posession. The challenge in designing a consent process for online studies is that they ususally do not provide an opportunity for the researchers and subjects to directly interact. 

Fortunately for researchers, HHS regulation allows them to obtain an electronic signature as a way to document consent. These regulations permit consent to be documented in a tangible format (written or in writing) which includes paper or electronic. An electronic signature can be an embedded image of a subject's signature, handwritten signature produced by a tablet computer, or encrypted digital signature. Researchers with access to electronic informed consent ("eConsent") platforms or other electronic signature softwares, like DocuSign, can make use of these technologies in their studies. For research that is subject to FDA regulations, the electronic signature requirements of 21 CFR Part 11 would apply

Nonetheless, the common rule allows IRBs to waive the requirement to document consent from subjects, as long as the study presents no more than minimal risk of harm to the subjects and the research does not involve procedures requiring consent outside the context of participation in the study. However, waiving the requirement to document consent does not waive the requirement for providing a consent process. 

One method of providing a consent process is to design an online consent form that includes a "live button" that subjects can click to demonstrate their consent. This version of an online consent form should include a statement to the effect of "Clicking below indicates that I have read the description of the study and I agree to participate in the study." This way, subjects are actively demonstrating their consent to participate. Note that this process does not produce a signed consent form for subjects or researchers to store as part of their research records. 

Other methods for securing consent for online studies include obtaining an electronic signature, as noted above, or sending a paper consent form to the subject via mail. Although the latter method produces a signed consent form, it also requires that the researcher collect personally identifiable information about their subjects that may not be necessary. Further, it may seem a little antiquated and burdensome to participants.

Researchers who may be using a fixed subject population restricted to a designated organization, such as students at a certain university or employees at a specific compant, could leverage any authentication systems already in place, like a username and login, as a way to document consent.

Securing consent online also raises issues regarding children. In the U.S, each state determines the age of legal majority, and the age of legal majority differs from country to country. It can be extremely difficult for researchers to know for sure if subjects are self-identifying accurately, such as reporting their age or geographic location.

Using a panel, such as Prolific, can provide researchers with the option to make their study available only to participants who are of legal majority age. While this may provide some assurance to the researcher and their IRB, one must recognize they are essentially relying on whatever information participants entered when signing up for the panel. 

Researchers may use informational age verification mesures, such as asking subjects to provide their age or year of birth, or by stating that subjects must be considered an adult to participate. However, these techniques do not guarantee honest responses or compliance. Researchers could make use of several age verification methods that may prevent minors from participating in research, such as age verification services (AVS). Nonetheless, internet research experts argue these products, though robust, are not infailable. Thus, in the absence of a foolproof method for determining the ages of internet users, researchers and IRBs should carefully consider these issues when reviewing some of the types of online studies endeavored. 

Another issue related to respecting the autonomy of subjects and internet based research includes incomplete disclosure, deception, and the complete absence of an informed consent process. The internet offers researchers compelling opportunities to study behavior unmediated by the presence of an observer. The internet also provides unique opportunities for observational research in private settings. For example, a researcher can register as a mamber of a closed group with relative ease to observe interactions among the members, while concealing his or her identity as a researcher, or use public blog posts about a group of individuals' private lives for research purposes without the individuals' consent. 

An IRB also may approve studies in which the informed consent process is completely waived, if it determines that the waiver is justified. For example, if a researcher wanted to study behavior and interactions among users of online virtual worlds, such as 
Second Life, the IRB could waive the requirement to obtain consent because consenting might alter the subject's behavior, thus requiring a consent process would make the research impracticable. In these types of studies, the researchers "lurk" to collect data. In some instances, researchers may even adopt a false identity or create a ficticious website in order to observe private behavior. Nonetheless, the relative ease of collecting data without consenting subjects calls for more discussion about applying ethical guidelines to research conducted in internet environments. Further, to meet the criteria for a certain category of exempt research, the HHS regulations require that if researchers are using deception that subjects prospectively authorize the deception (as they understand they will be unaware or misled regartding the nature or purpose of the research)

As discussed earlier, other issues pertaining to respecting the autonomy of subjects include whether researchers bear the responsibility to interpret their subjects' expectations of privacy and how to recognize those expectations. 

##### Recent examples of internet-based research
In the past decade, two high profile incidents demonstrate just how challenging it is to navigate these issues: the Facebook Emotional Contagion study and Cambridge Analytical scandal. 

The Facebook Emotional Contagion study showd that users of social media sites, like Facebook, may not fully understand all of the terms to which they are agreeing to when accepting a sites' ToS. 

In 2014, researchers from Facebook and Cornell published an article that showed Facebook users engaged in emotional contagion, or the transfering of positive and negative emotions to others, after being unsuspecting participants in their research study. For one week in January 2012, researchers manipulated news feed content for about 700,000 Facebook users. Half were exposed to content with happy and positive expressions, and the other half were exposed to content with expressions considered to be "sadder than average".

The researchers found that reducing the amount of positive expressions produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, users created more positive posts. Per the researchers, their "results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for masssive-scale contagion via social networks"

Although the study lasted just a week and only a fraction of Facebook's millions of users were exposed to the manipulation, none of the participants had consented to be part of an experiment in which their news feed would be curated by the researchers. While this is true, the researchers argued that the Facebook ToS, at the time, allowed for the "analysis, testing, and research".

Lack of consent from Facebook users was also the center of the Cambridge Analytica study. The study raides issues for consent in internet-based research. 

In 2018, a former employee of the British data consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, revealed to The New York Times, and The Guardian, that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from up to 87 million Facebook users, much of it without consent, and then misudsed the data. While some Facebook users had consented for their own data to be used for academic research purposes, information about other individuals in their social networks were collected, without those individuals' consent. The data were then used, not for academic purposes, but to create profiles of individuals that were then used to provide analysical assistance to U.S. presidential campaigns of 2016. 

This study raises the issue of consent in interned-based research in two major way. First, data for participants who had consented were misused. While they were told the data would be used for academic purposes they were used instead for political purposes. Second, data from people in participants' social network were collected. These individuals had not been provided with an informed consent form.

#### How can researchers minimize potential risks of harm to research subjects in internet-based research?
The greatest risk of harm to subjects taking part in social and behavioral sciences research is the inadvertant disclosure of private identifiable information that could damage their reputations, employability, insurability, or subject them to criminal or civil liablity. Several factors need to be considered when assessing potential risks. In most internet-based research, the primary risk of harm is loss of confidentiality.

##### Re-identification of data
Re-identification methods are unique to internet-based research. Two examples of reidentifying presumably deidentified datasets are the Harvard University "Taste, Ties, and Time" and the America Online search data leak.

###### Taste, Ties, and Time
The T3 study was a longitudinal study conducted by a group of researchers at Harvard University and the University of California, Los Angeles. The team was investigating the nature and dynamics of social networks using Facebook data from an entire cohort of undergraduate students at a university in the northeastern U.S. The researchers began collecting data in 2006, and continued data collection through 2009, at one-year intervals for each year of the cohort's college career. The result was a dataset that included "machine-readable files of virtually all the information" from 1,700 students' Facebook profiles.

Because the project was funded in part by an award from the NSF, the researchers were obligated by the terms of the award to share some of their data. In an attempt to protect the privacy of their subjects, the researchers did not identify the institution, removed the students' names and identification numbers from the dataset, and delayed releasing the cultural interests of subjects, such as movies, books, TV shows, and music. Additionally, the researchers required other researchers to agree to a "terms and conditions for use" that prohibited any attempts to re-identify subjects, disclose any identifiers that might be inadvertently re-identified, or otherwise compromise the privacy of the subjects. On Septemter 25, 2008, the researchers made the first wave of de-identified data available to the public. 

Within days, a researcher from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee was able to determine that the data came from Harvard University, and he did so without accessing the full dataset. Although he did not identify individual students, it was clear that the dataset included enough unique indirect identifiers to re-identify the students.

###### AOL leak
In the AOL search data leak of 2006, the internet service provider, AOL, released a dataset that included the search records of 500,000 of its users. AOL, in good faith, had intended to make the data available to benefit academic researchers. AOL had stripped the names from the data released and provided only what were supposed to be unidentifiable user numbers. However, within days, journalists from the New York Times were able to discover the identity of user number 4417749 by simply investigating the unique ssearch queries, which were notable for various reasons. The company eventually removed the data. 

##### Data storage
How the data are stored also raises confidentiality issues. Researchers can expect more challenges as technologies such as cloud computing, continue to develop. Cloud computing is the storage and delivery of resources, software, and information over an online network, rather than a physical product. Resources, software, and information are uploaded to and stored on "cloud services" in the U.S. and abroad. Users can then access and share these files remotely, and with relative ease. Encrypting data before uploading it to a cloud server is a recommended security measure.

Saving data to personal accounts that are unencrypted (such as Google Drive or Box account) or to devices (such as flash drives) is discouraged and potentially not allowed. Institutions' information security offices usually provide recommendations for secure data storage.

##### Data mining
New technologies continue to pave the way for careers and professions in data mining. Data mining is a field of conmputer science that involves methods such as artificial intelligence, statistics, databse systems management, and data processing to detect patterns from large data sets. Academic institutions offer training and professional education courses as well as degreed (bachelor's and advanced degrees) statistical methods and data sciences. It is important to consider the source of the data before mining it.

In data mining, researchers may use data scraping techniques to collect information from online data sources without consent. However, online data sources may have additional requirements of researchers. For example, researchers must use a designated Twitter API and submit an Academic Research application to use Twitter data for research. 

##### Unauthorized access
If email communications are used to recruit subjects, they may not be secure and may provide a record of subjects' identities. Similarly, hacking and unauthorized computer access have become an everyday possibility that researchers need to anticipate when conducting research in the digital age. Encrypting data while it is stored on a researcher's server is a recommended security measure. It is for these reasons that researchers should collaborate with information technology professionals to develop a data security plan. However, even the most careful security procedures used by a researcher can be voided if the subjects' computers are not secure.

##### Describing Confidentiality agreements to subjects
As mentioned in the previous section, the informed consent process should describe the extent, if any, to which the confidentiality of subjects' personally identifiable information will be maintained. It is clear that ensuring the confidentiality of personally identifiable information is challenging in internet-based research, not only for the data in their possession but data they make available to others. The ToS for online research tools and services, such as survey builders may state that all data collected on the tool will live on company servers indefinitely. Similarly, sites that offer automated speech-to-text transcriptions, may include exculpitory language or clauses waiving any liability for an inadvertant disclosure of audio files provided to them for transcription. As stated at the start of the module, researchers must take responsibility for understanding the privacy and confidentiality policies for such services, and inform participants of any limitations to assurances, where possible. 

After all, the common rule now requires informed consent process to explain whether data and any associated identifiers will be removed or used (or not used) for future studies or distributed to another researcher without additionaly informed consent.

Some internet-based research experts have identified several "best practices" for describing confidentiality protections to subjects. Some of these best practices include an explaination of how data are transmitted from the subject to the researcher, how the researcher will maintain and secure the data, and a discussion to emphazsize that there is no way to guarantee absolute confidentiality. 

##### Describing risks to subjects
Like in-person consent process with a writen form, online consent process should also include a statement to describe anticipated risks if there are any potential risks of harm or discomfort. If possible, the consent should explain how the researhcers intent ot mitigate those risks, or where appropriate, provide a debreif one participation has concluded. For example, if participants will be asked to respond to questions that are of a personal or sensitive nature, researchers can design the survey in a way that participants can skip questions that are of a personal or sensitive nature, researchers should consider including a "Prefer not to answer" option as a response. Another method, although perhaps a little more controversial, would be to use the consent process to inform participants that every question on the survey must be answered and they should simple end the survey if they get to a question they do not want to respond to. 

More recently, researchers designing online interventions in which they purposefully present participants with inaccurate information (such as "fake news") as part of their study now have to mitigate potential harms that could result from exposing participants to false information. Incorporating a funneled debreifing process followed by an actual debriefing script could mitigate potential harms, but only if participants fully complete the study, arrive at the debriefing statement, and read it. This is an almost impossible task to ensure when the researchers have minimal contact with the online participant.

#### The use of Bots in online research
While online studies "help researchers reach thousands of geographically diverse samples relatively quickly" and at a fraction of the cost, online studies introduce the risk of data integrity because of bots. A bot is an automated software application programmed to complete a task quickly and with little input from the human programmer. 

Since 2018, dozens of articles describing pervasive use and detrimental affect bots are having on online research studies have been published. One such article is aptly titled "Bots on Amazon's Mechanical Turk are ruining psychology studies"

There are simple methods to combat bots, such as addint attention or logic checks, a CAPTCHA task, asking the same question at two separate points, and including open-ended questions. There are methods that are a little more involved, like tracking time stamps of a study and flagging IP addresses to locate international and duplicate IP addressees, or IP addresses using a VPN. Still, programmers can design sophisticated bots that can mirror average timestamps, create a normal distribution across responses based on the range for each individual item, and even extract language from the survey to answer open-ended questions. While there may not be a surefire way to guarantee online studies will be "bot-free", researchers should take into account the impact bots may have on the research. This includes the data integrity and quality, and generalizability of the results, which can make the research study mean less. 

This can lead to problems from having inaccurate data, inaccurate analysis, and then having to repeat the study which increases time and financial costs. 

## Summary
Though the internet has much to offer researchers, researchers using it have several issues to consider before designing an  online research study. Some of these issues include user expectation about the privacy of their information, informed consent process, potential for re-identification of collected data, and that there are no absolute guarantees to ensure the confidentiality of personally identifiable information. Navigating these issues becomes much more intricate and complex when adding the fluid nature of the online world and the rapid development of new internet technologies into the equation. It is for these reasons that experts in the field of internet research ethics have described internet-based research as a "moving target"
