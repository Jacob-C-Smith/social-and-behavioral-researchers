# Institutional Review Board
## Learning Objectives

By end of the module, you should be able to:

- Describe the role, authority, and composition of the IRB.
- List the IRB requirements for conducting research involving human subjects.
- Describe the types of IRB review.
- Describe the process of working with the IRB.
- Identify other regulations and regulatory groups that require compliance based on the type of research being conducted.

## IRB Role, Authority, and Composition
An IRB is a review committe established to help protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects. IRB's must review and approve research involving human subjects IF it is conducted, supported, or regulated by the government. Research orgs may apply the requirements to all research.

### IRB Role
|Term|Definition|
|----|----------|
|Research|A systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge|
|Human subject|A living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; orObtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens |
|Private Information|“Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which the individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by the individual and that the individual can reasonably expect that it will not be made public (such as, a medical record)|
|Identifiable Private Information| Identifiable private information is private information for which the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information|
|Identifiable Biospecimens|An identifiable biospecimen is a biospecimen for which the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the biospecimen|
|Coded Private Information or Biological Specimens|The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP 2008) guidance considers private information or specimens to be individually identifiable when they can be linked to specific individuals directly or indirectly through coding systems. OHRP guidance recommends that only a knowledgeable person or entity be authorized to determine if use of coded specimen or data constitute research. OHRP recommends that researchers not be given authority to make an independent determination that research involving coded private information or specimens does not involve human subjects. |

|Term|Definition|
|----|----------|
|Clinical Investigation|Any experiment that involves a test article and one or more human subjects and that either must meet the requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug Administration...or need not meet the requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug Administration...but the results of which are intended to be later submitted to, or held for inspection by, the Food and Drug Administration as part of an application for a research or marketing permit|
|Clinical Trial|A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes|

### IRB Authority
- Approve research
- Required modifications (to secure approval)
- Disapprove research
- Conduct continuing reviews consistent with federal requirements and institutional policy
- Verify no material changes occurred since previous review
- Observe, or have a third party observe, the consent process and research
- Suspend or terminate approval

### IRB Composition
- At least 5 members
- Members from varied backgrounds and professions
- Non-scientist member
- Scientist member
- Unaffiliated member
- Reviewers sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise (professional competence) in the areas of research commonly being reviewed
- Diverse membership (Race, Gender, Culture; Sensitivity to issues of community attitude)
- Reviewers knowledgable of organizational commitments (including policies and resources) and regulations, applicable laws, and standards of professional conduct and practice

If an IRB reviews research that involves subjects that are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, the IRB must consider the inclusion of an individual who has knowledge of and experience with these categories. Regulations may require a voting IRB member who has relevant research expertiese. IRB's may call on experts to help with problematic reviews, but those persons may not vote on the disposition of the application. If an IRB member has a conflict of interest, that member can not be present for the review of that project, and may not vote on the project.

## IRB Requirements for Human subjects
### IRB (minimum) Requirements
Risk/Anticipated Benefit Analysis
 - Identification and assessment of risks and anticipated benefits
 - Determination that risks are minimized
 - Determination that risks are reasonable in relation to potential benefits

Informed Consent
 - Informed consent process and procedures
 - Documentation of informed consent (form)

### Potential Consequences When IRB Regulations Are Not Followed

- Suspension of research project
- Suspension of all of a PI's research projects
- Inability to use data or publish results
- Noncompliance notifications to sponsors, regulatory agencies, and funding agencies
- Debarment by FDA from using investigational products
- Inability to receive funding from federal grants
- Additional monitoring and oversight by the IRB and/or third party monitoring of research activities
- Termination of employment
- Loss of licenses
- Immediate shut-down of all research at an organization

## Types of IRB Review
1. Convened Committee Review
2. Expedited Review
3. Limited IRB Review of Select Exemption Categories
### Full committee review / review by convened IRB
This is standard. It must be used for the initial review of all studies that are not eligible for expedited review / exemption status

Greater than minimal risk research --> Convened IRB review required for initial review

- The review must be conducted at a convened meeting of the IRB. A majority of IRB members ( a quorum ) must be present at the meeting
- At least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas must be present at the meeting (in addition, FDA policy recommends that a physician be present)
- In order to approve research, the IRB must determine that all of the requirements specified in 45 CFR 46.111 (and if applicable, 21 CFR 56.111) are satisfied
- A majority of the members present at the meeting must approve the research
- IRB members who hae a conflict of interest in a research project may provide information to the IRB, but cannot participate in the review of the plan or be present for voting. Members with a conflict do not count towards the quorum for the review of that study.
- The IRB must notify (in writing) researchers and the organization of its decision to approve, modify, or disapprove the research
- IRBs must keep detailed documentation of meeting activities including attendance, voting on actions, the basis for the actions, and a written summary of the IRB discussion of controverted issues and ther resolutions

Although not specifically addressed in the regulations, IRBs may employ a "primary reviewer system" In such a system, all IRB members receive basic information about the research application, but a "primary reviewer" with experience and/or expertise in the study area is assigned to conduct a thorough review of the IRB application and any accompanying documentation ( for example, an Investigator's Brochure or informed consent form). The primary reviewer will then report findings for discussion at a full/convened IRB meeting.

At some organizations, reviewers may contact the researchar with questions or suggestions prior to the meeting. Additionally, the IRB at some organizations may ask that researchers attend the IRB meeting or be available by phone to answer questions that may arise at the meeting. 

### Expedited Review
Federal regulations can expedite review processes. This helps when you need to make minor changes in previously approved research. Expedited review may be carried out by the IRB chair or another IRB member designated by the chair. IRB members with a conflict of interest can not be designated to serve as an expedited reviewer.

Expedited reviewers may
 - Approve research
 - Require modification (to secure approval)
 - Defer review to the convened IRB
 - Review minor changes in previously approved research
 - Conduct limited IRB review if it is a condition of exemption status

Expedited reviewers may not disapprove research. Expedited IRB reviews must keep all the IRB members advised of research approved under expedited review. 

### Research categories
Federal regulations from the HHS establish two main criteria for an expedited review. Organizations may adopt some or all of the categories when determining if a research activity can be appropriately reviewed by an expedited review process. According to the common rule, the secretary of HHS will evaluate the list of research categories eligible for expedited review at least every eight years and amend it as appropriate

1. The research may not involve more than minimal risk. 
2. The entire research project must be consistent with one or more of the federally defined categories. 

**minimal risk** : "the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests"

Some organizations/IRBs have additional requirements. 

#### Category 1
Clinical studies on drugs or medical devices for which an investigational new drug (IND) application or investigational device exemption (IDE) is not required. Similarly, a study with a cleared/approved medical device that is being used in accordance with its cleared/approved labeling. More details.

#### Category 2
Collection of blood samples by finger stick, heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture. More details.

- from healthy, non-pregnant adults who weight at least 110 pounds. For these subjects, the amounts drawn may not exceed 550ml in an 8 week period, and collection may not occor more frequently than two times per week;

 \- OR -

-From other adults and children considering the following: the age, weight, and health of the subjects; the collection procedure; the amount of blood to be collected; and the frequency with which it will be collected. For these subjects, the amount drawn may not exceed the lesser of 50ml or 3ml/kg in an 8 week period, and collection may not occor more frequently than two times per week. Children are defined in the federal regulations as "persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted"

#### Category 3
Prospective collection of biological specimens for research purposes by noninvasive means. More details.

- Hair and nail clippings in a non-disfiguring manner
- Deciduous teeth at time of exfoliation or if routine patient care indicated a need for extraction
- Permanent teeth if routine patient care indicates a need for extraction
- Excreta and external secretions (including sweat)
- Uncannulated saliva collected either in an unstimulated fashion or stimulated by chewing gumbase or wax, or by applying a dilute citric solution to the tongue
- Placenta removed at delivery
- Amniotic fluid obtained at the time of rupture of the membrane prior to or during labor
- Supra- and sub-gingival dental plaque and calculus provided the collection procedure is not more invasive than routine prophylactic scaling of the teeth and the process is accomplished in accordance with accepted prophylactic techniques
- Mucosal and skin cells collected by buccal scraping of swab, skin swab, or mouth washings
- Sputum collected after saline mist nebulization


#### Category 4
Collection of data through noninvasive procedures routinely employed in clinical practice provided that:

- The noninvasive procedure must not involve general anesthesia or sedation routinely employed in clinical practice or procedures involving x-rays or microwaves.
- Where medical devices are employed, they must be cleared/approved for marketing. (Studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not generally eligible for expedited review, including studies of cleared medical devices for new indications.)

Examples of Noninvasive Procedures

- Physical sensors that are applied either to the body’s surface or at a distance, and do not involve input of significant amounts of energy into the subject or an invasion of the subject's privacy.
- Weighing or testing sensory acuity.
- Magnetic resonance imaging.
- Electrocardiography, electroencephalography, thermography, detection of naturally occurring radioactivity, electroretinography, ultrasound, diagnostic infrared imaging, doppler blood flow, and echocardiography.
- Moderate exercise, muscular strength testing, body composition assessment, and flexibility testing where appropriate given the age, weight, and health of the individual.

#### Category 5
Research involving data, documents, records, or specimens that:

- Have been collected; or
- Will be collected solely for non-research purposes (such as, for medical treatment or diagnosis).

#### Category 6
Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes.

#### Category 7
Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior. More details.

Including but not limited to, research on perception cognition, motivation, identity, language, communication, cultural beliefs or practices, and social behavior or research employing survey, inverview, oral history, focus group, program evaluation, human factors evaluation, or quality assurance methodologies

#### Category 8
Continuing review of research previously approved by the full/convened IRB where:

- The research is permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects; all subjects have completed all research-related interventions; and, the research remains active only for long-term follow-up of subjects;
- No subjects have been enrolled and no additional risks have been identified; or
- The remaining research activities are limited to data analysis.

#### Category 9
Continuing review of research not conducted under an IND application or IDE, and where categories 2 through 8 do not apply, but the IRB has determined and documented at a full/convened meeting that the research involves no greater than minimal risk and no additional risks have been identified.

### Expedited review process
In conducting the review, theexpedited reviewer must determine that the research meets the conditions for epedited review procedures. 

To approve a reseearch activity, the reviewer must make the determination that all of the requirements specified in federal regulations are satisfied.

If the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk (even if the study activities fit the categories on the secretary's list), the rationale for that determination must be documented and the study must be reviewed by the convened IRB

There is no continuing review requirement for research initially approved via expedited review. However, the organizations may have additional requirements requiring a "check-in" or other type of annual study review.

#### Review for exemption status
Federal regulations specifically define eight categories of human subjects research that are exempt from the other provisions of the regulations. Exempt does not mean that the activity is not research, and reviewe may still be required based on the requirements of the exemption category.

OHRP guidance indicates that the determinations of exempt status should be made by individuals independent of the research who are well-acquainted with the interpretations of the regulations governing the conduct of human subjects research. 

Many organizations grant the authority to make determinations of exempt status to the IRB. Check with the IRB office to find out who has been granted authority to make the exemption determination. **NOTE**: The determination must be made prior to initiation of research or of the activity; it can not be made retroactively. 

### Research that is exempt

#### Category 1
Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices, that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This inclused research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods

#### Category 2
Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, inverview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording), if at least one of the following criteria is met

- Information obtained is recorded in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;
- Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, or reputation; or
- Information obtained is recorded by the investigator in sucha manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by 46.11(a)(7)

**NOTE**: The federal regulations specify that this exemption's first two options, as noted at 46.104(d)(2)(i) and (ii), involving educational tests or the observation of public behavior may only apply to research with children when the investigator does not participate in the activities being observed

#### Category 3
Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met

- The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;
- Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, emplogability, educational advancement, or reputation; or
- The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by 46.111(a)(7)

For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting effect of the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.

If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she willl be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.

#### Category 4
Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospeciments, if at least one of the following criteria is met:

- The identifiable private information or identifiable biospeciments are publicly available;
- Information, which may include information about biospeciments, is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the idendity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, the investigator does not contact the subjects, and the investigator will not re-identiy subjects;

The research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator's use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR 160 and 164, Subparts A and E, for the purposes of "health care operations" or "research" as those terms are defined at 164.501 or for "public health activities and purposes" as described under 164.512(b); or
- The research is conducted by, or on behalf of, a federal department or agency using government-generated or private information that is or will be maintained or information technology that is subject to and in compliance with section 208(b) of the E-Governmnet Act of 2002, 44 USC 3501 note, if all the identifiable private information collected, used, or generated as part of the activity will be maintained in systems of records subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 USC 552a, and, if applicable, the information used in the research was collected subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 USC 3501 et seq.

#### Category 5
Research and demonstration projects that are conducted or supported by a federal department or agency, or otherwise subject to the approval of department or agency heads (of the approval of the heads of bureaus or other subordinate agencies that have been delegated authority to conduct the research and demonstration projects), and that are designed to study, evaluate, improve, or otherwise examine public benefit or serview programs, including: procedures for obtaining benefits or services under those programs. Such projects include, but are not limited to, internal studies by federal employees, and studies under contracts or consulting arrangements, cooperative agreements, or grants. Exempt projects also include waivers of otherwise mandatory requirements using authorities such as sections 1115 and 1115A of the Social Security Act, as amended.

- Each federal department or agency conducting or supporting the research and demonstration projects must establish, on a publicly accessible Federal website or in such other manner as the department or agency head may determine, a list of the research and demonstration projects that the federal department or agency conducts or supports under this provision. The research or demonstration project must be published on this list prior to commencing the research involving human subjects. 

#### Category 6
Taste and food quality evaluation and consumer acceptance studies

- If wholesome foods withoug additives are consumed, or
- If a food is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or belowe the level and for a use found to be safe, or agricultural chemical or environmental contaminant at or belowe the level found to be safe, by the FDA or approved by the Environmental Protection Agency or the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA

#### Category 7
Storage or maintenance for secondary research for which broad consent is required: Storage or maintenance of identifiable private information or biospecimens for potential secondary reserach use if an IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determinations required by 46.111(a)(8)

**NOTE**: Secondary research is the use of information or biospeciments that were collected for another (primary) purpose (for example, tissue collected for clinical purposes, samples left over from previous research studies, or medical records)

#### Category 8
Secondary research for which broad consent is required: Research involving the use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens for secondary research use, if the following critera are met:
- Broad consent for the storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of the identifiable private information or identifiable biospeciments was obtained in accordance with 46.116(a)(1) through (4), (a)(6), and (d);
- Documentation of informed consent or waiver of documentation of consent was obtained in accordance with SS 46.117;
- An IRB conducts a limited IRB review and makes the determination required by 46.111(a)(7) and makes the determination that the research to be conducted is within the scope of the broad consent referenced in paragraph (d)(8)(i) of this section; and
- The investigator does not include returning individual research results to subjects as part of the study plan. This provision does not prevent an investigator from abiding by any legal requirements to return individual research results. 

## Certain research may not be exempt
According to 45 CFR 46 (Protection of Human Subjects 2018), research involving the following is **not** appropriate for exemption

- Subjects that are prisoners (except for research aimed at involving a broader subject population that only incidentally includes prisoners)
- Surveying or interviewing of children
- Observations of public behavior of children where the researcher(s) participates in the activities being observed

### Special considerations for IRB review
Researchers and IRB reviewers should be aware that there may be special consideration for different types of research. For example, certain policies may limit the IRB's ability to waive the requirements for informed consent, or research that may normally be considered exempt will require IRB review. 

For example, the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy (GDSP) for human and non-human data has implications for researchers if they want to access data from this database or if they want to provide data to this database and they are NIH-funded. Under this policy, the IRB must review the research if the researcher will provide data to the database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbGaP) and the research is NIH funded. IRB review would not normally be required under the regulations because the activity would typically be considered non-human subjects research (NIH 2014)

If the PI receives funding from NIH and needs access to the database, the non-human subjects determination cannot be used. The research must be reviewed by the IRB to ensure that there were adequate consent provisions for the collection of the specimens. 

### Additional HIPPA requirements that indirectly affect the review of exemption status
The privacy rule is a federal regulation under the health insurance portability and accountability act (HIPPA) of 1996 (45 CFR 160 and 164). If an IRB has been given the responsibility to consider HIPAA issues in research and if the research potentially falls under the purview of HIPPA, an IRB will be applying not only the 45 CFR 46 exemption categories, but also determining if HIPAA applies. 

In some cases, HIPAA applicability requirements are more stringent than HHS exemption requirements, and in other cases, less stringent. A research project that is exempt from the human research subject IRB requirements may not be exempt from HIPAA provisions. In addition, a project that is not exempt from IRB review might be exempt from HIPAA. OHRP has guidance entitled "Research Involving Coded Private Information of Biological Specimens" and the NIH has guidance on IRBs and HIPAA Privacy Rule. 

## Process of working with the IRB
Researchers will work with the IRB over the entire duration of the research study.


### Criteria for IRB approval
Federal regulations at 45 CFR 46 and 21 CFR 56 list basic criteria that the IRB must apply when reviewing research involving human subjects (specified in 45 CFR 46.111 and 21 CFR 56.111)

To approve a research project, the IRB must determine that:

- The risk to subjects are minimized
- The risks are reasonable in relation to any anticipated benefits to the subject, and to the advancement of knowledge.
- The selection of subjects is equitable
- Informed consent will be sought
- Informed consent will be documented or appropriately waived
- When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provisions for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of the subjects
- There are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data
- Where any of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect subjects.

### Types of IRB submissions
The PI and research team are responsible for submitting applications, amendments, or modifications, and reports during the course of the study to the IRB. 

#### Application for initial review
The first request for approval of a specific project is the application for initial review. 

#### Application for continuing review
The IRB must re-review studies that are greater than minimal risk not less than once per year. An IRB may require review more frequently depending on the IRB's assessment of the study's risk/benefit ratio. The review may be a full or expedited review. Unless an IRB determines otherwise and documents its justification, review is not required for minimal risk research (research that was eligible for expedited initial review) or research that is in data analysis or subject follow-up only (clinical data from clinical care procedures)

#### Amendments or Modifications
Changes cannot be made to approved studies, including the informed consent document, without prior IRB review and approval. The review may be full or expedited, depending on the magnitude of the change and the effect of the change on the risks/benefits ratio. 

#### Reports of unanticipated problems/adverse events/noncompliance to the IRB
The IRB may require reports for
- Adverse events or unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others
- Incidents of noncompliance
- Deviations from an approved study plan and violations of the terms of approval
- Data safety and monitoring report summaries

### Application for initial review
The initial review may be either a convened/full committee or an expedited review depending on the type of study, subject population, and level of risk

### Application for continuing review
The IRB must do substantive continuing review and consider the same issues as during initial review. Specifically: 

- When conducting a continuation review, the IRB uses convened/full committee review and procedures. 
- To approve research, the IRB must determine that all the requirements for initial approval continue to be satisfied
- IRB should review, at a minimum, the research plan and any amendments, as well as a status report, including: 
  - The number of subjects enrolled
  - A description of adverse events, unanticipated problems, withdrawl of subjects, complaints, and summary review of relevant new information
  - A copy of the current informed consent document

Review the latest on applications for continuing review in OHRP's guidance [link](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/guidance-on-continuing-review-2010/index.html)

Continuing review must occor, at a minimum, once per year of previous approval. More frequent review is at the IRB's discretion, and may be the result of considering the risks associated with the study or the proposed population. It is a researcher's responsibility to know when IRB approval will expire. However, most organizations/IRBs, as a courtesy to their researchers, send out reminders that IRB approval is about  to expire. Sometime prior to the expiration of IRB approval, researchers iwll reveive a request to complete a progress report for continuing review by the IRB. It is a researchers responsibility to complete the continuing review request and submit it back to the IRB prior to the end of the current IRB approval period. 

If a research plan's approval expires before the IRB completes its review, the researcher must stop all research procedures. When stopping the research could place subjects at risk, the researcher should contact the IRB immediately to obtain approval to continue treating subjects on that study. 

### Amendments and modifications
All amendments and modifications to study need IRB approval before they are implemented. If the researcher wants to change anything in the research that would affect the subjects (such as, recruitment procedures, key personnel, inclusion/exclusion criteria, research procedures, and the informed consent document/process, or data elements collected), the researcher must obtain IRB review and approval prior to implementation of the changes. 

The only exceptions are changes neccessary to immediately protect subjects' safety, as noted in the federal regulations (21 CRF 56.108(a)(4) and 56.115(a)(1), and 45 CFR 46.108(a)(3)(iii)).

If researchers are unsure about reporting changes to the IRB, they should call the IRB office and ask for guidance. The IRB office can also provide researchers with instructions for submitting a request to modify IRB-approved research

### Reports of unanticipated problems/adverse events/noncompliance to the IRB
Federal reporting requirements for IRBs, researchers, and funding sponsors can be confusing. Consequently, IRBs tend to develop their own reporting requirements, based on their interpretation of both FDA and OHRP guidance. This poses some difficulty for researchers because if the project is funded, the sponsor may have reporting requirements that differ from the IRB's policies and procedures.

At a minimum, to ensure compliance, the researcher is responsible for

 - Determining the IRB requirements for reporting with respect to what needs to be reported, when it should be reported, and the procedure for submitting the report
 - Setting up systems to ensure that reportable events are identified and submitted to the IRB in a timely manner

Examples of reported events include:
 - Unanticipated problems
 - Serious adverse events
 - Exceptions
 - Deviations
 - Data safety and monitoring plan or reports
 - Subject complaints

 The IRB will use the reports to assess wether the risk/benefit ratio is still reasonable, wether changes in the informed consent document or study procedures are needed, or whether re-consent is neccesary. IRB requirements for reporting vary regarding what should be reported, when the reports should be submitted, and how the reports are formatted. Check with the IRB to determine its specific requirements

### Additional reporting requirements for the PI

Besides the IRB, the PI is responsible for reporting to a variety of other entities. Minimum reportng requirements for each entity are summarized below. 

 - Research subject : While it might not be considered reporting in the strictest sense, the informed consent process is a report to the potential subject about the research, both before the research begins and on an ongoing basis throughout the study. Also, if new information becomes available during the research that might affect the subject's willingness to participate, a researcher is obliged to provide the subject with that information. This information will also need to be reported to the IRB. The IRB office can provide guidance on how additional information should be reported
 - Organization : Most organizations have reporting lines set up so that the researcher makes reports to the IRB and it falls upon the IRB to keep the organization informed. However, check with the applicable IRB to make sure that the researcher does not have direct responsibility for reporting incidents to the organization. 
 - Sponsor: Adverse events should be reported immediately to the sponsor. Researchers should also check the sponsor's proposed changes that might be made to the study, based on the adverse event that has occored or preliminary findings. The sponsor also should be told about serious or ongoing noncompliance in a study
 - FDA : Adverse events/unanticipated problemns should be reported directly to the FDA if the research is PI-initiated (without external sponsorship) and falls under the FDA's purview. Other reporting requirements related to FDA-regulated research may apply.
 - DSMB/DSMC : If the project has a DSMB/DSMC, check  the DSMB/DSMC plan for reporting requirements

### Recordkeeping responsibilities for the PI
PIs are responsible for retaining signed consent documents, IRB correspondence, and research records for at least three years after the completion of the research activity. However, local organizational policy or sponsor requirements may dictate that records be kept longer. Check with the sponsor and IRB office to make sure that the minimum three-year retention requirement meets their needs.

The FDA regulations specify unique document retention requirements that must be met for FDA-regulated studies, as noted in 21 CFR 312.62(c).

The signed informed consent document is one of the most critical research records the researcher needs to obtain and keep. It provides verification that the research was explained to the subject and that the subject understood and voluntarily agreed to participate in the research study.

## Other regulations and regulatory groups
Depending upon the nature of the research and the funding agency, there are a number of other regulations, policies, and procedures that may need to be considered. This section includes a brief description of select regulation, regulatory bodies, and funding agencies that  may oversee research. Funding agencies and/or local IRB offices can also provide guidance on whether any additional requirements apply to a research activiy.

## Cooperative research and single IRB (sIRB) review
Cooperative research projects are research studies that involve more than one organization. According to 45 CFR 46.114, "any institution located in the US that is engaged in cooperative research must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research taht is conducted in the US
